1) download all comment data
2) begin with titles and text. Try to id entities and do sentiment analysis just on this
2) Subset data and begin analysis on tiny portion of data to see if methods work/what methods work
3) Sharpen techniques on small data subset and finalize
4) Iterate through entirety of dataset, saving sentiment rating per day? maybe per post? probably easier to get a per-day rating for each player which is manageable
5) collect statistics
6) design and integrate dashboard
