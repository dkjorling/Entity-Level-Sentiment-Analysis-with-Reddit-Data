-add parent level 1 and 2 entities/counts

-begin sensitivity anaylsis, familiarize yourself w vader and getting general text sentiment

*****THOUGHT********
The challenges of the sensitivity analysis are twofold:
1) distinguishing sentiment of individuals mentioned in same post
	a) idea: tokenize into sentences if mentioned different sentences, else take sentiment of that sentence
2) training in specific lexicon, that is sports, specifically nba, and social media
	b) use the specific name reference to add context!!!***


## emojis ##

## we have options for emoji utilization ##
1) find a sentiment model that allows emojis to be passed as tokens
2) replace emojis w descriptions
3) concatenate to end of post/tweet/sentence
4) treat as metadata, use sentiment lexicon rankings to layer in, while training text with no emojis

*twitter roberta can directly take in emojis and perform well*
*vader sentiment also seems very good.....*

FOR NOW: create df column for posts/comments

## another thing to think ab: should i not remove periods so I can keep sentences? will this make entity-level sa easier??

## top x nicknames or funniest nicknames




2) Subset data and begin analysis on tiny portion of data to see if methods work/what methods work
3) Sharpen techniques on small data subset and finalize
4) Iterate through entirety of dataset, saving sentiment rating per day? maybe per post? probably easier to get a per-day rating for each player which is manageable

6) design and integrate dashboard
	i) home page: last game and opponent w score....last 5 w results and opponents, win streak, 		current  record, sentiment, pelinka sentiment, bus sentiment, hamm sentiment, top player sentiment, top trending player sentiment (by gain), bottom/bottom trending
	ii) individual player sentiment and can alter time for individual player here




### dashboard design ###
-would be rad to embed youtube highlight vids for each player!
