1) download all needed nba data and create functions for dashboard
	a) check contents of other api data
		i) this has better game date...use it...see example for celtics
	*try to find num possessions eahc player played in each game at a minimum
	b) turn team (team_date class?) and player (player_date class?) into classes and put current functions in respective classes
		i) create beginning roster list
		ii) create transaction dict that alters the roster list by date ( 1 in dictionary with player in and date, 1 out dictionary with player out and date) this alters roster list
		ii) create transaction dict w date and player in/out
		iii) create get_current_roster method and integrate into player class
		iv) last game, last opponent
	c) *** create rolling team statistics as well. include: over last x games/ n days and show:
		i) record (already have functions for this)
		ii) ppg opg (think i already have this data
		iii) more advanced stats....note these only need to be in per game....create additional features that are currently not in the list

2) begin with titles and text. Try to id entities and do sentiment analysis just on this
2) Subset data and begin analysis on tiny portion of data to see if methods work/what methods work
3) Sharpen techniques on small data subset and finalize
4) Iterate through entirety of dataset, saving sentiment rating per day? maybe per post? probably easier to get a per-day rating for each player which is manageable
5) collect statistics
6) design and integrate dashboard
	i) home page: last game and opponent w score....last 5 w results and opponents, win streak, 		current  record, sentiment, pelinka sentiment, bus sentiment, hamm sentiment, top player sentiment, top trending player sentiment (by gain), bottom/bottom trending
	ii) individual player sentiment and can alter time for individual player here
