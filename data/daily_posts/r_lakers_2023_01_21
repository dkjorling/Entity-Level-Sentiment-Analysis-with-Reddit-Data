And then play physical with him. Continuously bump him all of the time. And don’t let him take easy shots.”,TriggerHappy999,,1.0

8,2023-01-21 20:34:23,10i0x75,As long as we net two good starters with the two firsts I don't care if we keep Westbrook,TradeWestbrick,"I hate on him because the trade for him killed our championship prospects, he's disgustingly overpaid, and his fans are hellspawn but he's undoubtedly been a positive player for us with AD out and he and LeBron have one of the best on-court ratings together in the NBA over this stretch.

The biggest issue with him is he can't close because of how erratic he is and he fucks up our spacing around LeBron and AD. If we can bring in two good starters who can shoot and keep him on the bench in closing situations then it would be fine to keep him, arguably better compared to alternatives. Ham just needs to make sure he staggers him with only one of LeBron/AD and never play him with both.

Someone suggested doing

Pat Bev + Thomas Bryant + FRP for Myles Turner

and

Lonnie + Nunn + Damian Jones + FRP for Gary Trent Jr.

-------

Final rotation of 

Schroder, Gary Trent Jr, LeBron, AD, Turner

Westbrook, Reaves, Christie, Troy, Wenyen

To me this is the only deal that rivals the Pacers one. Both would firmly push into championship contender status.",1.0

10,2023-01-21 15:28:20,10htpqf,How do I bet on the Lakers winning a ring?,January_Weather,"I think we can do this. LBJ has been a scoring monster. Couple dud games here and there but doing everything he can at 38. AD isn't out for the year. Westbrook has turned the clock, playing like his rockets stint. Dennis comes through everynow and then. Lonnie, imo is our best pick up, he elevated the bench.

This team plays harder than last year ever did. And that's despite the 0-7 start. We're winnin a fuckin ring. how can i bet on that and how much would i win if i bet 100?",1.0
