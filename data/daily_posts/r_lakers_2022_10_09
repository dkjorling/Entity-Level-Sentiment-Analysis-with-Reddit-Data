You‚Äôll be a better informed fan afterwards (hopefully).",EvilGeniusGL,"I really don‚Äôt like Anthony Irwin. He‚Äôs my least favorite person who covers the team. He thinks he‚Äôs disliked because he ‚Äúsays things that are difficult for fans to hear‚Äù, but that‚Äôs not it. I appreciate his honesty when things aren‚Äôt great in Laker Land. It‚Äôs his snarky attitude, delivery, etc that make him irritating. 

HOWEVER, he is so right on the money in this 15 min pod that I almost listened to it twice. See, when I woke up to the news that accountability still isn‚Äôt a thing with the Lakers and that Rob got an extension I was angry. I‚Äôm rarely on this sub during the offseason, but I checked it out today because I wanted to vent with other fans that were surely going to be upset like I am. Right?!

Nope. I‚Äôd say 50-70% of the sub came out with excuses, false hope, while also being defensive to anyone saying otherwise. I‚Äôve been reading this sub for awhile now, but I always held back from commenting because I wanted to avoid wasting time arguing w others.  I started to post around free agency, when we were all pitching trade ideas that never came close to fruition.

Now, whether you like the Pelinka extension or not, I‚Äôd advise everybody to listen to this quick emergency pod by Anthony/Silver Screen &amp; Roll. He masterfully breaks down Rob‚Äôs tenure here. Hopefully you come out of listening to it nodding in agreement or waking up from dreams of delusion.",0.32
