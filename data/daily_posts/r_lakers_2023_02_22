0,2023-02-23 05:28:50,119pkkh,NBA league pass sucks for Lakers games if you want to watch live,kindtdp1,"So I actually paid for $129 for the NBA league pass premium this season. Itâ€™s sucks. I donâ€™t recommend it at all if you actually want to watch games live (Iâ€™m guessing most people do). For games broadcasted on TNT/ESPN/ABC, youâ€™re blocked from watching it until around 3 hours after the game ends. I think out of the last 10 games, 7 of them were on national TV so yeah, pretty much unusable.

Tomorrowâ€™s warriors game is on TNT again, so yet another game I canâ€™t watch. I had no idea the NBA league pass was this useless.",1.0

11,2023-02-22 22:21:28,119ftcj,Still not over losing Kobe,SophisticatedBalls,"Everytime I see a video of Kobe or something show up on my Twitter or ig feed, it's hard to watch. I never took a celebrity death hard until him, man. It really feels the same way as when I lose a family member, like it still doesn't make sense to me that he's gone. 

Maybe that's crazy to some, but Kobe was my hero since I was 6 and I'm sure a lot of y'all can relate. His combination of wisdom and determination is unmatched. And as someone who grew up without a real father figure, I looked at Kobe and he was the dad I wanted. I just cannot express how much I miss this man I never even knew.

I just wanted to share with y'all and open a discussion to anyone who feels the same way.",1.0

Do they have a track record of being slow with shipping? I know their site says ""Please note some items will not ship until a later date."" This has been two weeks (10 business days). Just curious because I could have just waited and ordered it from [Nike.com](https://Nike.com) and gotten by now.",1.0
