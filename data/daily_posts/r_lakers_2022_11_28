6,2022-11-29 07:08:24,z7mgj2,This loss goes back to how people were complaining that the team just freezes AD out in the second half when he has a dominant first half.,simplenicc,"Bron is still an incredible player but he should be taking a backseat to AD with how efficient and dominant AD has been.  It‚Äôs one thing to say you‚Äôll hand the keys over, its another to actually do it.

Westbrook is Westbrook at this point.  Really sucks to choke this one away esp with how well we‚Äôve been playing but if we‚Äôre going to stay afloat during the REGULAR season, then we need to lean on AD who is finally healthy and able to perform at a high level.  This will lighten the load for Bron and if we somehow make the playoffs, that‚Äôs when he can shine",1.0
7,2022-11-29 07:08:10,z7mgdi,This loss to the Pacers is on LeBron and Russ,Immediate-Gap-9980,"So down the stretch when it was a close game, to my amazement Russ had the ball in his hands and of course either turned it over or did one of his ‚Äòone on three‚Äô drives to the basket. 

I don‚Äôt know why the hell the ball was in hands for the last few possessions. I‚Äôm thinking this whole time in the last 5 minutes of the game, why the fuck didn‚Äôt they give the ball to AD? 

I‚Äôm looking at the plays and it‚Äôs LeBron jacking up shots or Russ doing his useless dribbles all over the place. Why not clear everyone out and give the ball to AD. And don‚Äôt say AD has to demand the ball, that‚Äôs a bit hard to do when Russ or LeBron doing iso plays.

Also, in the 2nd half of the game we don‚Äôt see the bench lineup that was providing earlier. Lebron tweaks his ankle and then in the 3rd and 4th he starts taking stupid shots. Then in the 4th we have Westbrook. He gets a good bucket, then on the next play he does some stupid shit like miss a layup or randomly throws the ball hoping a teammate catches it but ends up in a turnover. That cycle from him kept happening in the 4th. Also, we leave their shooters uncontested in the 4th. We know they can shoot but for some reason, letting them shoot is a good idea.

""If it feels like you‚Äôre being gaslighted by Rob Pelinka, well, you‚Äôre not the only one. This would be the third deadline and second postponement of a deadline to start the season.

First, it was the 20-game mark that would serve as a large enough sample size before making a deal. Then it was Dec. 15, the date that players signed in the off-season can be dealt. Both of those dates have some logic based in them.

This newest deadline? Ehhhhh. This is when it‚Äôs starting to feel like the Lakers are just looking for reasons to not work out a trade. Look, there may not be a lot of deals available right now on the trade market, which would be fine. But nobody asked for these deadlines and offering them up only to basically ignore them when they arrive is silly.""",1.0

I'll post this again in a minute to duplicate posts.

I'm impossibly pessimistic about everything about this team (No gloom and doom posts what a fucking joke thats basically all this sub is)

Miscellaneous draft talk: Ho You Fat is a really funny name. 

LeBron vs Kobe: Kobe is the better Laker, Lebron is the better player.
