13,2023-01-11 08:08:39,108zevu,Dispelling the notion that this team is refusing to make a trade in order to reset the repeater tax,BrianC_,"I see it mentioned often here that this team is refusing to make a trade or take on more salary because they are afraid of the repeater tax.  Now, I'm not saying that the team won't make moves to reset the repeater tax -- I actually think that's fairly likely and mentioned it years ago.  I'm making this topic to show that the idea that they won't make a trade because of the repeater tax is just not accurate.

In order to do this, I will look at the hypothetical math of the deal so many people mention when discussing the team's reluctance to make a trade, the Myles Turner and Buddy Hield deal.  Below is the relevant data for the off-season if such a trade is made --

#Projected Roster

Player Name | Cap amount
:-- | :-- 
LeBron James | $46.9m
Anthony Davis | $40.6m
Buddy Hield | $19.3m
Max Christie | $1.7m
*Total payroll* | *$108.5m*
*Luxury tax cut-off* | *$162m*
*Luxury tax cut-off - payroll* | *$53.5m*

&amp;nbsp;

#Cap-holds

Player Name | Cap amount
:-- | :-- 
Myles Turner | $27m
Austin Reaves | $2.1m
Wenyen Gabriel | $1.9m

&amp;nbsp;

#Relevant exceptions

Exception Name | Cap amount
:-- | :--
Non tax-payer MLE | $11.4m
Veteran minimum exception | $2m
Undrafted rookie minimum exception | $1.1m

&amp;nbsp;

*There is also an additional first-round-pick cap-hold of ~$2.3m as well as additional cap-holds for empty-roster spots.*

*Damian Jones does have a player-option for next season, but in the event where he opts-in, I am assuming the team would salary dump him.*

&amp;nbsp;

So, what do all these numbers mean?

The first number is the projected space under the luxury cut-off of $53.5m  The team will have that much money to re-sign Turner, re-sign any other players they intend to keep like Reaves, and fill out the roster with exceptions.

First, Myles Turner.  The biggest problem and likely the real reason for why the deal wasn't made is that Turner is an expiring contract and a potential half-season rental that needs to be re-signed.  Because the team has traded so many assets for him, it would be a disaster to let him walk.  As such, he'll have the leverage to ask for as much money as he wants with the threat that if the Lakers FO doesn't agree, he'll walk and leave them to deal with the massive blow-back of spending multiple FRPs for just a few months of Turner.  This is normally why half-season rental deals don't cost much.

I'm not going to assume that Turner hard-balls the team for a $40m+ AAV max length contract.  That would be a fucking disaster.  I'm going to assume that in such a scenario, the team would instead opt to let him walk and instead convert his contract with another team into a sign-and-trade.  So, we'll assume that Turner or the trade-exception received in a sign-and-trade and subsequently used would cost $30m.

That leaves the team with $23.5m before hitting the luxury cut-off.  Assuming the team decides to keep Reaves at a value of $11.4m which has been mentioned in certain reports (though I personally don't believe he'll be paid that much), that brings the team to 7 empty roster spots with $12.1m to fill them.  That could be filled with a 20ish selection FRP, 3 veteran minimums, and 3 undrafted rookies/SRPs (I believe the team has 2 SRPs).  In this scenario, in order to avoid the luxury cut-off, the team would potentially not use their MLE aside from signing their SRPs.

#Final Roster

Player Name | Cap amount
:-- | :-- 
LeBron James | $46.9m
Anthony Davis | $40.6m
Myles Turner | $30m
Buddy Hield | $19.3m
Austin Reaves | $11.4m
Max Christie | $1.7m
First-round pick | ~$2.3m
Veteran minimum exception | $2m
Veteran minimum exception | $2m
Veteran minimum exception | $2m
Undrafted rookie or SRP | $1.1m
Undrafted rookie or SRP | $1.1m
Undrafted rookie or SRP | $1.1m
*Total payroll* | *$161.5*
*Luxury tax cut-off* | *$162m*

&amp;nbsp;

Even in this example, there is some room for more flexibility.  First, there is the possibility that Turner doesn't get $30m.  Second, there is the possibility that Reaves doesn't get $11.4m.  On top of that, Buddy Hield could also be moved for slightly less salary.  The point is that even if the final numbers seem tight, there is still a lot of workable space under the luxury cut-off.

So, in reality, even if a trade is made, the team can still field a roster next season that is under the luxury tax cut-off.  And, in my opinion, that roster might not even be that bad if the FO can continue to find good value with FRP/SRPs and minimum exceptions.  Do I think they should and hope they will just pay the extra tax?  Yea.  I think if you bring back Wenyen with his early-bird rights and use the full MLE, that roster is still a potential contender with the right pick-ups at the minimum.",1.0
