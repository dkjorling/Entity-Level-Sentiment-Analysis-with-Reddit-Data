The Clippers on the other hand gave up SGA, someone’s who’s looking like an MVP candidate, and a boatload of picks for a singular WCF trip and a mid tier all star in Paul George. No one is in the comments of those posts bashing the Clippers front office for holding him back.",1.0

3,2022-11-17 05:30:23,yxhp7y,Let’s make the trade,Immediate-Gap-9980,"You look at the current state of affairs in the NBA, you’ll see it is wide open and very few legitimate contenders. 

In the western conference, the top two teams are the Trailblazers and Denver. If I’m LeBron, those two teams would not put any fear into me if I have a decent team. The Clippers aren’t going anywhere with Kawhi injured, Chris Paul looks like he’s now washed, and the Warriors hopes with Poole, Klay, and the young guys are all but over. Dallas only had one true superstar, Pelicans need more seasoning, and Timberwolves aren’t going anywhere. 

Look at the Eastern conference, the only two teams that worry me are the Celtics and the Bucks. But if we get some more shooting and defenders, and if LeBron and AD are healthy, I think we can beat them. 

So I’m saying make the trade this season, might not get another good opportunity to win a championship given the current state of the league.",0.78

17,2022-11-16 18:43:40,yx26ae,Hield and Turner make the Lakers Contenders This Year,mexicanmike,"Let’s break down the Western Conference “Contenders”:

Warriors: currently 6-8 with no defence and no bench.

Clippers: the Kawhi situation is completely up in the air and no guarantee that he can play meaningful minutes.

Nuggets: they are good, MPJ has the usual health concerns, but I expect the team to trend upwards. Nuggets currently looking like one of the tougher outs.

Phoenix: similar to last year, a deep well coached team. However, can CP3 do it in the playoffs, will they collapse again?

Grizz: they are a good team, but against an improved Lakers squad, are they insurmountable? I don’t think so.

Pelicans: a good but youthful squad that hasn’t made any noise in the playoffs.

Utah and Portland: both of these teams are unlikely to keep up their current trajectory, and aren’t that scary in a 7 game series.

My point, all of the preseason “Contenders” are looking vulnerable. No team is out of reach. With a trade, the Lakers can make some serious noise in the playoffs.

If the thinking is that LeBron or AD can’t stay healthy enough to make it work? Fuck a WB trade, blow the whole thing up.

25,2022-11-16 17:24:06,ywzuzj,Here’s why Rob is smart in not trading Russ and our picks for role players who won’t make us significantly better,69-peepeepoopoo,"Now brace yourself. What I’m about to say is gonna take some logic and common sense to understand, so I already know that isn’t going to go well in this sub. 

But let’s face facts. No move we make is going to make us a contender. We are a bad to mediocre team, that can at best be a solid mediocre team making any of the trades that are constantly whined about here. So flush more picks down the drain for a possible 2nd round sweep? Great idea. 

I’m pretty sure our front office knows this despite what all the big brains in this sub think. What is happening right now though is that Russ is on an upward trajectory and redemption arc, and everyone loves a redemption story. 

What is realistic is that Russ keeps playing himself into a elite role player that will make him a hot commodity come trade deadline and then he can be flipped to a contender for actual value that will actually benefit this franchise and it’s future, and not cost us future picks we need. I know the Bronsexuals hate to hear it, but this is what’s good for the franchise, not Bron.  Hell, I don’t even think Bron really cares as much at this point anyway, at least based on his attitude. I think he’s happy playing and living in LA, chasing Kareem, watching his kids ball.",1.0
