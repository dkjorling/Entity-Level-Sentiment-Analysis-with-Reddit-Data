Either way, the future is bright and hopefully FO turns it around soon for the Lakers.

Position | Starter | Min | Reserve | Min

SF | James | 36 | Walker or Brown | 12

C | Davis | 36 | Bamba | 12
.  
btw I think Vanderbilt is our best wing-stopper, so even though I have him listed as the starting PF, I think he'll be guarding the SF instead of LeBron when they're on the court together.  

Not sure if Walker or Brown will be the backup SF, but it probably doesn't matter too much because I don't think either will be playing in the playoffs.  
  
Lastly, I have a sneaking suspicion that Ham is going to want to close games with LBJ/AD/Reaves/DLo/Schroder...

In the back court I would assume Russell starts, but who would be next to him? As much as I like Beasley offensively, his defense is not what we want next to Russell. Maybe start Austin reaves? Schroeder might be an option but we need a point guard coming off the bench. What do y‚Äôall think?",1.0

It‚Äôs exceptionally difficult to defend with that lack of size in today‚Äôs spread-out NBA. 

**It‚Äôs not an accident the Lakers have allowed 117 points per 100 possessions in minutes with two 6-foot-1 or shorter players** and 118.5 in the minutes where they had three of them out there.
