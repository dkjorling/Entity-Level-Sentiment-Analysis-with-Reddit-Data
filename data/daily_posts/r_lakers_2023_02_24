36,2023-02-24 17:26:04,11awtgq,D Russell is biggest x factor between play in / early playoff loss and real contention,Empathetic_Walrus,"Two things:

- of course we need to stay healthy, obviously that is the biggest factor for any team

- our bench / role players are legitimately good. Reeves, Hachimura, and Dennis can play real playoff minutes 

Which leads me to the biggest factor of this season - Russell. Watching the game last night I found myself thinking man if we had Kyrie (putting aside baggage and just focusing on talent) we would be in the inner circle of contenders.

With Russell I'm not sure what to expect. He can be 60% as good or 85% as good as kyrie. Early returns are promising. He seems motivated. His ceiling IMO determines it all. Against Phoenix or Denver in a series we need him to be 20+ a game consistently.

Everyone else (assuming decent health) feels predictable and we know what were getting.",1.0
