It takes time that we don't have to build chemistry, and that's just the reality of the situation.

I'm honestly just looking for positive signals for the remainder of the season that gives us strong confidence that we can contend in 2023-2024. Anything on top of that is a bonus.

What would you consider a success?

17,2023-02-16 21:39:55,1141wrp,Thoughts on new roster/playoff aspirations.,Smoovekriminal1999,"I just wanna jump the gun or anything like that, BUT dammit we look good. Health, and continuity have been our biggest issues since the 2020 championship season. We‚Äôve rebuilt the roster every year since then, and we‚Äôve been injured ever since then. It‚Äôs impossible to get a rhythm going. But with the squad we have now ima trust Rob to keep them all long term. 

Aside from that let‚Äôs talk playoff aspirations. Currently 13th, but we‚Äôre 3.5 games back from the 6th seed and 2 games back from 10th. With the all star break this weekend, and our next game being next Thursday, this puts us in an excellent position to rest, practice and gel with the new guys, and build that continuity and chemistry we‚Äôve been lacking. We have 23 games left and realistically I think we go 17-6. 

The only genuine threats to us in the west IMHO are: Phoenix, Denver, and the Warriors. Anyone else I believe we could get by smoothly.",1.0

20,2023-02-16 19:51:25,113zct1,Beasley as a starter,TipsyOtter,"First off, great to see such a dominant performance last night. 

I know a lot of people want to see Reaves as a starter and that may still happen as Ham changes starting lineups seemingly every game. But I believe Beasley as a starter is a good thing. The gravity Beasley brings as a 3pt threat opens up lanes for our big 3. Alternatively, our big 3 allows for volume shooters like Beasley to get the shot going early. It‚Äôs a nice recipe for good 1st quarter performances such as last night. Not to mention Beasley‚Äôs defense wasn‚Äôt too bad either. 

As for Reaves, he could very easily be a starter and I wouldn‚Äôt argue very hard with anyone if they pushed for it. But I‚Äôve always liked Reaves decision making as it seems he‚Äôs able to make the right play or organize the offense when our stars are out. That and he‚Äôs a bit of a Swiss Army knife in terms of molding his game positively given the lineup. He knows how to be aggressive on the second unit but also knows how to be a complementary player when playing with our stars. That‚Äôs something Beasley probably can‚Äôt do as he‚Äôs more of a one dimensional player. 

TLDR: Beasleys good as a starter because shooting. Reaves is a good second unit guy cuz he‚Äôs more versatile.",1.0
21,2023-02-16 19:26:33,113ys26,The next adjustment Ham needs to make is giving Rui more on ball defensive responsibility especially against forwards.,blacPanther55,"(I'm not associated with that account)

&amp;#x200B;

We saw Rui absolutely lock down Julius Randle in New York a few weeks ago. Then in the Bucks game he did a good job of stopping Middleton when they were matched up. Of course Vando should be the wing stopper from now on but Rui should be the next man up instead of Troy Brown Jr.

I know that it's nearly impossible to have the same exact roster for next year but keeping the core of LBJ, AD, DLo, Reaves, and Vando would be great. I hope we pick up Beasley's team option too if he keeps shooting well. I'm not sure if we have enough money to keep Rui and Dennis is probably gonna be worth more now. Mo Bamba is also under contract next year so I hope he also plays well.

Do you think our championship window is still open if we keep the same core for next year? A 39-year-old LBJ. a 30-year-old AD who is hopefully healthy, plus a decent supporting cast should be enough to be competitive. 

The only problem is Darvin Ham's coaching lol",1.0

The bench mob of Dennis, reaves, TBJ, Rui, and Bamba are also solid af and you can mix and match these two units as long as you don‚Äôt play people out of position and it will work flawlessly. The crazy part is we still have Lonnie, Christie, Reed (who isn‚Äôt great but hits the 3 at a decent clip and is serviceable), wenyen and soon to be Kevin love. I went to a laker game this year and Lonnie, Christie and Wenyen played big minutes and we won! That 3rd starting 5 would work the Russ, bev, and Dennis lineups imo just because of size, balance, and better shooting.

We invested so much support, confusion, years w the young core which didn‚Äôt really give off on the grand scheme of things (Except for 2020) , Kobe hugging the trio on his last game, DLo being our ‚Äúfuture superstar‚Äù years ago, etc., 

And just seeing talks of a contract extension gives me a little tickle in my heart, you know? (Too corny, I‚Äôm sorry)

A ring with DLo would really have a full circle for the Byron Scott tank commander era. All the years we spent hoping a young LA drafted superstar would take us to the promised land. We may not get that specifically, but with DLo as our PG plus a ring (here‚Äôs to hoping). So much sweeter than 2020. 

I myself dont like recency bias because of the win, he‚Äôll surely have bad games here and there, but I hope he gets better fan support from us. 

I hope he stays with us and I still hope he turns into a superstar. An LA drafted superstar CHAMPION. (Soon, hopefully.)

Die Hard Laker fan and DLo fanboy",1.0
