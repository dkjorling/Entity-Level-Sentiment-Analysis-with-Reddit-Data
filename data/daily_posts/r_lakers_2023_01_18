2,2023-01-19 06:59:14,10fv69f,Concerning stat about our late game offense,Character_Safety_519,"Let me preface this by saying in no way am I blaming our losses on Lebron.  He is by far our best player with AD out and without him we might have a worse record than the Rockets.

With that being said, we‚Äôve all noticed the glaring issue in our late game offense is how stagnant it gets.  The ball stops moving, and we routinely go to the same play: Lebron iso on the perimeter, he holds the ball, and shoots a contested 3.  In years past this was a decent look and guarantees that your best player takes the critical shots.

[However this year Lebron is shooting](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/shots-closest-defender?CloseDefDistRange=2-4+Feet+-+Tight&amp;PerMode=Totals)‚Ä¶

- 29.3% from 3

- 11.1% from 3 on contested shots (nearest defender is 2-4 feet) on 27 attempts 

For reference Westbrook is shooting‚Ä¶

- 29.3% from 3

- 18.2% from 3 on contested shots on 11 attempts

I completely understand that our lack of shooting is killing our spacing *but* we can‚Äôt rely on an 11% 3-pointer during late game situations.  Also I‚Äôm not at all saying Westbrook should be taking those shots either.  Surely our coaching staff can figure out higher percentage offensive schemes for late game.

TLDR: Lebron is shooting 11% from 3 this season on contested 3-pointers which is a signature of our late game offense",1.0

8,2023-01-19 06:04:22,10fu7sy,I think it‚Äôs safe to say Darvin Ham is the worst coach in the Nba right now,Junior_Cantaloupe_23,We literally can‚Äôt win games that go down the wire with Ham . His garbage rotations is just horrible . His play calling is even worse . His love for Westbrook is just literally D riding to the point he seems like a fanboy with how much unnecessary play time he gives him . His obsession with a small ball lineup constantly fucks us on defense .During crunch time Ham decides to put Bev on Harrison Barnes who then scores a basket getting fouled in the process which basically changed the momentum of the game. The dude put 5 guards at one time against the Mavs . To nobody‚Äôs surprise C.wood dropped the easiest 30 bomb of his whole career. It‚Äôs clear Ham sucks and is the problem,1.0

2. We can‚Äôt defend for shit. They have the hall at the 3 point line while being one of the best shooting teams in the league? Yeah leave them open. That‚Äôs the most logical choice. Thomas Bryant can‚Äôt defend my chihuahua. 

3. Our 3rd quarters are bad? Well say hello to the 2nd quarter where we go from up 14 to down 1 at the half. Kings are making every shot and even the ones where the ball bounces off the rim and backboard like 7 times before somehow rattling in which happened about 5 times. 

4. If we don‚Äôt play defence anyways we might as well give swider some pt to see if he can hit some shots, at least try something different. 

5. Similar to 4, there are no adjustments. I admit, I was a ham supporter and a Vogel critic but I came to realization that ham isn‚Äôt  ready to be a head coach. He doesn‚Äôt know how to use timeouts, doesn‚Äôt know how to keep a lineups in when they are doing great, and can‚Äôt take players out when they are hurting us. 

None of this is a surprise but it‚Äôs just pissing me off how this is happening and even if we win, it still isn‚Äôt acceptable how we played for the 2nd and 3rd quarters. Now In the 4th kings were in bonus with 8 mins left in the game.",1.0

35,2023-01-18 17:28:00,10fd50v,The reason why Beverley has been so much worse on offense this season compared to with Minnesota is because his AST has been cut in half,Nathan185,"This is going to be a tough post for some people to be open-minded to, and I understand, because Patrick Beverley has been a disappointment for the most part this season.

Pat Bev was rightly hyped up as someone who was going to impact the Lakers and ‚Äúdo the little things‚Äù before the season, and for good reason: Patrick Beverley‚Äôs advanced stats in his season with Minnesota were INCREDIBLY good. Most impact metrics had him as one of the most impactful role players in the league. Most impact metrics had him as around a +3.0 per 100 possessions on the floor, which is incredible for a player that averages less than 10 PPG.

The main reason for this is that PatBev averaged 4.6 assists per game last year for the Timberwolves, on only 1.3 TOV. That is incredibly efficient playmaking, bordering on Chris Paul levels of taking care of the ball. Patrick Beverley‚Äôs strongest trait is that he is a very efficient secondary playmaker.

Now that he‚Äôs playing with a team with Russ (and to a lesser extent LeBron), literally all they let him do is catch and shoot 3‚Äôs, and rather than using his high AST/TOV playmaking, they insist on running the offense through Russ, who has a poor AST/TOV ratio.

What this team needs badly is shooters, not playmakers. PatBev is an extraordinary secondary playmaker, which is why he‚Äôs been a viable player in the league for so long, but he never gets to playmake because Russ has the ball the entire time LeBron is on the bench.",1.0
36,2023-01-18 16:47:31,10fc325,"Since the beginning of 2023, Lebron James and Russell Westbrook lead the NBA with the highest overall net rating of +42.1 for any 2 player lineup that has played a minimum of 100 minutes together.",Freeeecurry,"
Lebron James and Russell Westbrook have recently been putting in some work together and their chemistry has shown on the court. 

With an offensive rating of 130.1 and defensive rating of 87.9 the duo is leading the league in two player lineups for the overall best net rating of +42.1

Even more interesting is that Westbrook is listed three times in the top 25 two player lineups indicating that when he‚Äôs on the floor the lakers are playing well. (Russ + Wenyen, Russ + Schroeder)

Undoubtedly, Russ has made it easier for Lebron to score and Lebron has been the ultimate complimentary off ball player for Russ.

In their shared minutes, Russ has mostly been running the offense something that is very new even to this season, and once AD returns Russ will have two of the best off ball options to get the ball two taking the lakers offense to an even higher level

This is obviously better for the lakers if he continues to play all year, but does it matter with regards to his value as a tradeable asset?   


I would almost argue that unless he starts shooting a league average 3 pt percentage, he would not be able to help a team compete for a championship and the only teams willing to trade for him would be ones tanking and trying to shed long term salary.   


With that being the case, his trade value may have actually decreased as he is more likely to help a team that does not want to win, win a few more games.",1.0
