We just don‚Äôt have the luxury of ‚Äúoh this one‚Äôs on me.‚Äù We need wins and we need them ASAP.

Knock that shit off man get them wins come on let‚Äôs go.

Just another winnable game thrown away‚Ä¶ so yes I get it the world isn‚Äôt over and it‚Äôs not the final game of the season.. but eventually it‚Äôs gonna be to close and we‚Äôre not doing ourselves any favors with these dumb losses.",1.0

This is what I found from doing research during my lunch break. If someone has more information please share. 

It‚Äôs also worth considering how other team‚Äôs tiebreakers are set up but that would be a lot of scenarios &amp; I figured for the next 2 weeks our tiebreakers are all we should pay attention to until those pan out. I‚Äôll put the link at the bottom if anyone wants to see every teams tiebreaker situation. 

‚ÄúIn tiebreaker scenarios that include more than two teams, the nod, in order, goes to the team with the best win percentage in all head-to-head matchups among the teams involved.‚Äù

Tiebreaker vs. Clippers: Clippers clinched

Tiebreaker vs. New Orleans: Lakers lead 2-1 with one to play

Tiebreaker vs. Utah: Jazz lead 2-0 with two to play

Tiebreaker vs. OKC: Tied 1-1 with one to play

Tiebreaker vs. Portland: Blazers currently own via conference win percentage

He should have had Rui on Randle and Vando on RJ Barrett for most of the game. Even with the foul baiting Rui was giving Randle trouble because of his size. Plus, Vando would have helped with the rebounding. The lineup should have been: Dlo/Reaves or Beasley/Rui/Vando/AD.",1.0

But also not matching up vando and Randle‚Äôs minutes later in the game, playing small three guard lineups when we were getting killed on the glass in the middle of the game, all of it was bad. 

And what was with the timeout before hart‚Äôs second free throw? Why not save it if we can‚Äôt get the ball in or for two quick possessions? We threw the game essentially by putting all our hope into hart missing.",1.0

People gotta realize tough Vando n TBJ had a very off night we was still fightin we were close, also AD played badly but we didn‚Äôt get blown out we didn‚Äôt stop fightin. I agree that was a very winnable game n an important one but it‚Äôs far from over, that bein said FTs FTs FTs need to improve 2 more made FTs we take it to OT, even 2-3 More we would‚Äôve won. One made 3 from TBJ we either win or take it to OT. It was just an unlucky night players who were hot since the ASB break went cold n we lost only by 4 in a close game. I would rather drop the game now than drop the B2B against NOLA n Houston. Let‚Äôs not forget it‚Äôs not a race, it‚Äôs a marathon. Also 2 main things that worry me, rebounds and bigs, we need to sign a big mainly to rebound n have size against other bigs just like Dwight in the 2019-2020 run.

People saying Malik Beasley isn‚Äôt really a good shooter despite the guy being way better than LITERALLY ANY SHOOTER WE HAD BEFORE. Others out here saying Max Christe should have gotten minutes. OVER WHO EXACTLY?! The guy isn‚Äôt ready for important basketball games simple as that. Lastly everybody acting like this is such a crippling loss; when in actuality it really isn‚Äôt. There‚Äôs still time to play well and right into the top 6 seeds. We just had one bad shooting game guys. No need to act like it‚Äôs the end of the world!,1.0

The teams we were rooting for yesterday didn't even want to win so we went 0-2 in that as well.

New week, today will be a better day.

Rooting Guide.

1. **Grizzlies(-1.5)** over the Mavericks
2. **Heat(-7.5)** over the Jazz
3. **Hawks(-5.5)** over the Timberwolves
4. **Suns(+4.5)** over the Warriors

We are the 11th seed now but high chances we move up at the end of the night. Rest up, we have a game tomorrow.

GO LAKERS!!!

Was there a reason he didn't go for 40-50? 

Were the knicks doubling him?

23,2023-03-13 09:53:13,11q5ffy,Anthony Davis,Mental-Safety-1067,I know since he's left the Pelicans he's gained a ton of weight to be a good center but isn't that the main reason he gets injured? Pelican AD I don't remember having a lot of injuries but then again he was younger. Could AD ever go back to being in the 4th position instead of being limited because it seems he's slower and his ball handling has gotten a bit worse. I could be dumb but doesn't hurt asking. I know his birthday was recently so he could've been hungover vs the Knicks. Would there be any downside to him losing weight?,1.0
24,2023-03-13 08:57:44,11q4iqn,Just an unlucky game,ThunderClown101,"The LA Lakers are right on track with their goals. 

They wanted to go 16-8 after the all-star break, they are at 6-3 and 8-4 since the deadline. 

Can‚Äôt win every game. 

AD didn‚Äôt dominate last night, TBJ and Malik were ice cold and the team shot 58% from the FT line. 

Also didn‚Äôt help that Randle and Barrett both have gotten 30+ on the second night of a B2B. They are almost never this good together. 

They went 10/36 for 25 combined against the Clippers, but they go 23/51 for 63 combined against the Lakers literally the next night.

This is just extremely unlucky when you combine it with an off shooting night by LA. 

On the next one, let‚Äôs go 7-3 again in the next 10 games and get to 40-38. 

Hopefully this loss with give more motivation to AD because he can‚Äôt afford to play like he did the last 2 games. 

He needs to average 25/10 for LA to get to the playoffs.",1.0
