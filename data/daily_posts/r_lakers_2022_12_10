17,2022-12-10 13:23:56,zhshlq,LAST NIGHT WAS NOT ADS FAULT.,Bright-Feature,"Last nights fault was not ads . The man had 9 points coming into the 4th qtr and e dropped 22 in the 4th ended with 31 on 13 shots . He shoudlve had 40 if these dumbass players passsed him the ball the first three qtrs and the refs didnâ€™t call this bullshit fouls on ad. Man was in foul trouble the whole game and still had 31 thatâ€™s impressive as fuck. I wish he hit that free throw too but we still wonâ€™t to Ot when we shouldâ€™ve lost. 

But you know who you can blame , RUSS AND BRON. Bron was 9-22 (1-8 3pt) all he did was shot hack thereâ€™s slowing the offense down and OT he didnâ€™t score once. RUSS Mr triple double player like shit idgaf about the rebounds and assist when you shoot 4-14 missing point blank layups both him and bron. Russ needs to be traded heâ€™s so inefficient even coming off the bench averaging 15 on 40% 29%3pt and 68ft he ainâ€™t worth 47 mil . 

Also blame it on the horrible permiter defesne we have no good wings, and hamm loves putting 4 guards out there and embiid destroyed it. We let a random go off for 30 points. This team just is net good enough win, we probably wonâ€™t make the playoffs or play in if something doesnâ€™t happen. Myles turner fixes our issues protecting the paint when ad on the bench , buddy hield helps with this teams lack of shooting. Not gonna win a lot of games when you canâ€™t shoot , thatâ€™s why when lakers get blown out like the raptors game they canâ€™t come back cause w event shoot a lick. This team sucks and we  had some hopium cause we had a good 10 games stretch against bad teams and had the perfect game against the bucks.",1.0

19,2022-12-10 09:38:43,zho7of,Lebron's contract is a problem,philawsophist,"Love bron, but I think it's clear that he's (understandably) not the player he used to be. The problem is that his production is way below his contract value right now. He can no longer get to the rim at will off the dribble, despite way fewer attempts. His step is just too slow to get past anyone, which is also why he can't stay in front of anyone on D. 

Also, his slow step/ lower vertical leads to tougher shots/defense, which means he can't finish at his rate anymore. He seems like he's imitating westbrick layups out there most of the time, for the majority of this season. Sad to see.

So pretty much, his game right now is entirely dependent on whether his 3ball/ jumpshot is falling. Unfortunately, he's a mediocre shooter. He's getting paid max money to be a mediocre shooter/ shit defender, with fancy plays every once in a while like any decent role player. 

No es bueno",1.0
