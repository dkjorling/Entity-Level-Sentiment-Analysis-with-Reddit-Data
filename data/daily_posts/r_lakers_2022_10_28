11,2022-10-29 04:20:01,yg9rbb,Does our fanbase watch the games? Painfully obvious that our FO has been planning on punting this season for months already,PotatoSwag2318,"Look at my post history. I have been calling this shit since over 6 months ago to plenty of downvotes.

I remember saying Jerami Grant and Christian Wood could be had for 1 FRP each when formulating a theoretical off-season plan for us and being called delusional.

I remember saying that the Pacers trade should have been taken at the price of 2 FRPs months ago and being told how it was ‚Äútoo expensive‚Äù.

I even remember remarking that our plan this past off-season should have been to go ALL-IN or ALL-OUT (my preference is ALL-IN) just to see upvoted copium calling for patience and half-measures. 

I remember saying that we run the risk of punting the season entirely by trying to wait on a trade in the idiotic hope that it would increase our leverage. The only way our leverage would increase by the deadline is if we remain high enough in the standings (8th seed-ish).

Yes, I am a LeBron fan and that is why I root for the Lakers. But I am sick and tired of our sub and our ‚ÄúLaker‚Äù fans. So many of you guys are reactive and not proactive. I warned you guys about Jeanie so many times and people are finally starting to get the message. The worst part about rooting for the Lakers has been how many ‚Äúfans‚Äù have been looking to blame Bron at any chance they get when realistically he should be the last person to blame.

Age 38 season, still our best player. Brought us ring 17 and would have won in 2021 as well had AD not gotten injured against the Suns. Bron and even AD are the last 2 people to blame in this situation. 

Bron wanted Ty Lue, wanted Dudley to stay as a coach, wanted Caruso. How come our FO was able to say ‚ÄúNo‚Äù then? In fact, he even wanted Demar over WestBrick but Jeanie didn‚Äôt want to commit to Demar‚Äôs 3yr contract. So why in the world are we not directing all of the blame towards Jeanie and the FO? The Russ trade is on them. Not only could they have had Demar instead, they also said ‚ÄúNo‚Äù to LeBron many other times before, why couldn‚Äôt they say no again in the supposed buildup to the WestBrick trade? 

Whether the Lakers luck into success, maximizing winning still requires not only a FO overhaul, but Jeanie/Buss family selling their majority stake of the team to richer ownership. They can arrange for a smaller minority ownership if they so please. I knew we were headed for a punted season months ago and I can‚Äôt believe how many of you gave our FO the benefit of doubt as they are continuing to take half-measures.",0.55

18,2022-10-29 03:39:41,yg8yn7,It's a wrap: Lakers should think about rebuilding and just keep the two first-rounders.,Apart-Bad-5446,"Barring getting a superstar talent, I don't see title contender on this team.

1) Old age is finally catching up to Bron in a way that I think 'this is it'. He's getting decent numbers but the impact isn't there. Peak LeBron would be able to carry this team on his back. I'm not seeing a scenario here where the LeBron is a top 10 player in the league and if he isn't that, the Lakers have no one capable of leading them to a title.

2) AD has not taken his game to the next level. From 6 ft to the 3P line, he's shooting 15%. He doesn't get to the FT line because he's afraid of contact. He's shooting 18% from three. Other than easy baskets under the rim, AD has not been a reliable offensive option.

3) Westbrook... we don't need to rehash this.

4) Patrick Beverley has been ALL TALK, NO ACTION. Blanking wide open threes, making silly fouls, borderline unplayable at times.

5) Who on this team can step up? No one. Lonnie has looked good but he can't shoot the ball.. 18% from three but he's the Lakers second best option. Other than Austin Reaves and Matt Ryan (both take a few threes per game) shooting, the next best shooter is LeBron at 26%. Kendrick Nunn has been an utter disappointment. Troy Brown can't do anything offensively. Juan Toscano, zip. NO ONE on this team can contribute.

6) Unless the Lakers get a superstar player and round up the roster with some good shooters, there is no point in wasting picks. As it is, this roster is not a title contending team, period. Anyone thinking it will somehow magically get better is delusional. The only improvement I'm seeing is defense. Other than that, the offense is historically atrocious. 

IMO, this Lakers squad should HIGHLY consider trading BOTH LeBron and AD. Keep Westbrook and tank for Wembanyama. That is the ONLY solution I see. Why? We've been saying it for quite some time now but AD is not a SUPERSTAR CHAMPIONSHIP talent who can lead your franchise. Keep his name out of Doncic, Jokic, Giannis, etc., category. He can't carry a team. IDC what anyone says. Bron is too old. Let this guy compete for a title on a team that actually has a chance. Get some picks, younger talent, and rebuild. There is no other way. Lakers are not winning with this roster, period. And Hield/Turner won't change much because the rest of the guys on this team are not contributing.",0.48

70,2022-10-28 18:22:03,yfwlfz,We are in serious danger of becoming like the Knicks,william4534,"Y‚Äôall are really not gonna want to hear this, but it‚Äôs true. This isn‚Äôt just another ‚Äúwe suck and it‚Äôs Jeanie‚Äôs fault‚Äù posts, this is bigger than that. This is about the next decade plus of Lakers basketball.

We have a completely incompetent, money hungry owner who knows next to nothing about basketball, constantly banking on stars wanting to play here because of reputation and treating actual roster construction as an afterthought, cycling through coaches every other year to act like the front office isn‚Äôt the problem, etc.

If this keeps up much longer, we will be the Knicks of the west. Big market that fringe stars will flock to, but nobody actually looking to contend will so much as consider coming here. The only way to break this cycle is to completely and entirely gut the front office and ownership of the team, and when I say gut I mean GUT IT. The entire Buss family gone, the Rambi gone, Pelinka gone, and everyone with any ties to them gone. We cannot afford to have the slightest connection to those nepotistic dipshits because any connection is a foot in the door. This is serious.

It‚Äôs so damn hard to be loyal to a team that isn‚Äôt loyal to the fans, but if things don‚Äôt change it‚Äôs destined to stay that way for a long time.

Edit: alright since a bunch of you are having an aneurysm trying to comprehend the fact that our past success has next to no impact on our future, let me spell it out. I know we are WILDLY more successful than the Knicks, I get it, you don‚Äôt have to say ‚Äúwe won a ring two years ago‚Äù over and over again. What I‚Äôm saying is that going forward, our front office is incompetent enough that, if ownership doesn‚Äôt change, we could seriously be looking at a 15-20 year stretch just like the Knicks have had. In 2040 we could be the team that has the reputation of ‚Äúbig name, big city, haven‚Äôt won shit in decades‚Äù.",0.76
71,2022-10-28 18:02:57,yfw0sv,"Lakers Roster, Shooters, &amp; Gravity",kwesi777,"It‚Äôs crazy how other rosters have like 6-8 guys who can knockdown an open/semi open 3 on a consistent basis vs our roster. 

Obviously our 19-20 chip team didn‚Äôt have elite shooting, but guys like KCP and Green would make you pay if you routinely sagged off them. I think we were like 20th or 21st in 3P as a team that season, but we had the guys to give us *enough* gravity in crunch time of big games. 

Just looking in the West alone at the Mavs, Warriors, Suns, Pels, Flippers, hell, even the Kings‚Ä¶they all got at least 5 or more players who can create gravity and hit jump shots. 


Realistically, we know many of our players are underperforming shot wise, and it‚Äôs not like the shot quality has been terrible either. So while it‚Äôs possible some guys will revert/ascend to their mean, even assuming that, we are still probably 2-3 shooters short of having any semblance of a coherent offense. That‚Äôs not to speak about a legit center to preserve AD‚Äôs fragile ass, but we are just so behind the curve in terms of anyone who can remotely create any gravity at all. 

All that said, if Rob is hypothetically able to get 2-3 spacers for Russ and 1 pick while packaging Nunn or Lonnie with another pick for a center, I guess that would kind of fix this roster? Maybe we‚Äôd be a wing stopper short still. 

What do you all think? The alternative is of course punt on this season but that would obviously suck having two seasons of a black hole in terms of not being an ass team.",0.9
