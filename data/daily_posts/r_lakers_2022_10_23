8,2022-10-24 03:35:06,yc129f,This Portland loss reminded me of the Patrick Beverley interview with Stephen A Smith earlier this summer,Joumbled,"While the early Westbrook shot at the end of the Portland game isn't the only reason the Lakers loss, it was an extremely boneheaded error. Even if he made the shot, it was a bad decision based on the timing and situation. Due to the recent comments made by Lebron and Ham, it reminded me of the interview of Patrick Beverley earlier this summer when he mentioned possibly going to the Lakers.

[https://youtu.be/JIBiYQbT-Zo?t=457](https://youtu.be/JIBiYQbT-Zo?t=457)  (7:37 - 8:38)

He essentially talked about leadership and accountability, specifically with Lebron and his defensive errors. But he also mentioned that he would talk to EVERYONE about mistakes in the game. Does anyone think that this has actually happened? Considering Pat Bev and Westbrook were essentially best friends at training camp, I think there's a shot, but we also have to think about the reluctance Westbrook has shown in ""sacrificing"" his game, changing roles, and taking ownership from mistakes with the media.

I just hope these conversations are actually happening INTERNALLY. Just like the recent Draymond Green situation and aftermath, things really should stay behind closed doors. It doesn't have to be brought up by Pat Bev, Lebron, or Coach Ham, but I just hope somebody speaks up.

Again, I don't think Russ lost the game with that possession. There are so many things the Lakers could have done differently and improve on, but I just hope that ALL mistakes and errors are properly communicated and proper accountability occurs. This includes all coaching mistakes, all basketball skills deficits, and all the things that prevent the team from winning basketball games.",0.68

**NO**, every team and their mothers know brick is  trash. Any team accepting a Russ trade will do it to sit him, not  because he's a serviceable player. FO is focusing on the wrong thing.

FO  needs to focus on lifting our bargaining position (pretend that we're not desperate  for a trade) which means winning games. Which means sitting brick,  especially in crunch time.

Instead,  FO is focusing on increasing brick's individual player value, which (1) no potential trade partner GAF about, bc they will waive him after the  trade anyway, and (2) is actually lowering our bargaining position, because we seem more and more desperate for a trade with each game.

Pelinka  is literally the dumbest GM of all time. A pure reactionary, just tryna mitigate his disasters instead of proactively tryna make the team  better. What a fucking nincompoop.",0.79

39,2022-10-24 00:03:18,ybwvkp,The Russ Problem,Pure_Competition_481,"Imagine a safety leaving a receiver wide open to go double up on the other reciever because he knows that his assigned receiver can't catch the ball. The offense is now essentially playing with 1 less guy than the defense making it harder for the other receivers to get open and make catches. Now imagine playing 4 on 5 in basketball and that sums up the Russ experience so far. I didn't watch to much of the game tonight but I did keep up with it enough to see the same things I saw in the first 2 games. The Lakers obviously can't shoot and Russ definitely isn't the only problem the team needs to adress, but Russ is clearly the most glaring on court issue for this team. Teams literally  choosing to ignore Russ existence is simply unacceptable for a guy making 47 million. I've never seen a player hurt a team this way (granted I am fairly new to the basketball scene so I could be wrong about this), teams actually want Russ on the floor because it makes guarding Lebron and AD that much easier for them. They more specifically want Russ on the same side as Lebron and AD so they can just double one of the 2 with no repercussions if the lakers choose to do anything involving them. I mean Lebron and AD can pass it back to Russ but why do you think he's being left open in the first place? Because he's not even a half decent shooter so he'll more than likely miss it, a randomly sporadic passer so he will likely turn it over and a inefficient finisher at the rim which he can't get to anyway because that's where Lebron or AD are getting double teamed and he can't really shoot freethrows that well in the event that he does make it. Lebron and AD can't get much of any one on one action because of Russ lacking offensively in many parts of his game. There's no fear of an AD post up or Lebron drive when know you can abandon Russ and double up or clog the paint. The other players on the team can't shoot but they can finish at the rim, pass at a controlled rate and at least get enough respect to where their man isn't standing like 10-17 inches away. I also don't get why Ham is still playing Russ with all the ""earn it"" talk he was discussing before the season, especially in moments where the team is simply playing better basketball and winning without him. Maybe it's because he wants to prove that Russ can work, Maybe it's the Gm trying to get nonexistent trade value which won't work at all, or maybe Russ just holds more power than people thought. Either way he said he wasn't changing anything about how he plays and these are simply the results of that. Other than that tho I'm looking forward to joining this space I chose the Lakers because I liked the color scheme really so I guess I'm here for the ride now. Feel free to voice your opinions on this matter and say where you feel I'm wrong because I like seeing things from others perspectives. I also don't want to seem like a guy who just goes around bashing players on anything they do wrong, like if Russ stays I hope he can turn it around but I just don't feel like he can. Anyways Go Lakers!",0.72

At least last year we had guys who could make ""some"" 3's this year's team is the worst 3pt shooting team i've ever seen in all my years watching the NBA. I can't see this team winning more than 40 games and if we get ANY injuries I can see less than 33 wins.",0.57

What is it with these 3 guard lineups. Russ get the ball in transition and idk if he was going for the 2 for 1 but that lil midrange brick was unacceptable and deflating. I know we‚Äôre holding out for a trade but at this point just send this bum home or bury him on the bench.",0.84

Sorry fellas forgot about the pick swap. This just sucks watching how poorly this team was constructed. We fell so far from 2020. We need to rebuild our front office I‚Äôm so tired of them mfers",0.2

At this point his trade value has to be gone right? No one that is trying to win would want him. We need to make a call to the Pacers and Jazz soon. I‚Äôll leave it at this ‚Äúfuck them picks‚Äù,0.8

89,2022-10-23 22:15:44,ybukpn,This is it. Westbrook should not start nor close games anymore!,tall_mf_,"Though this loss might suck, I think Ham will also realize that Russ sucks even more. We had great momentum towards the end of the 4th quarter before Russ got checked in and ruined all of the moment. It‚Äôs actually insane how much Portland sagged off Westbrook and he still isn‚Äôt able to make the shot. 

In the end, this loss is unfortunate, but I think it‚Äôll make the coaching staff realize that Westbrook shouldn‚Äôt close any games. 

The best thing to do from here is to have him come off the bench and lead the second unit, but don‚Äôt let him touch the floor in the 4th quarter",0.91

Literally costing us,LeBrons7thRing,"This guys talking about ‚Äúfacts over feelings‚Äù and holding guys accountable that‚Äôs all fake. His personal relationship with Russ is more important to him what a joke

Against the Clippers LeBron + role players lineup has momentum in the 4th and puts Russ back in the game Zubac guards him and leaves him open and we lose. This game LeBron and AD have momentum and he puts Russ back Nurkic guards him and leaves him open and we lose. ClownShow from Ham",0.9

99,2022-10-23 22:09:16,ybuf71,It‚Äôs Time To Investigate Westbrook For Tanking,chrismatic13,"I‚Äôm not even a Russ hater, I‚Äôm actually one of his few defenders. Russ has been put in a bad spot but it‚Äôs clear he‚Äôs using that as an excuse to do whatever to escape accountability. Russ is being defended by Nurkic, at times vs the Clippers‚Ä¶Zubac. Why in the world is he not driving by players he‚Äôs faster than by a mile? What PG routinely chucks 3‚Äôs or contested 2‚Äôs when defended by a slow footed big man? Even Steph, the greatest shooter of all time, will get to the rack on a mismatch.

Westbrook has never had the best shot selection but it‚Äôs getting to the point he‚Äôs actively taking bad shots, giving poor effort, and doing anything that can contribute to a loss. And end of the day, he played ‚Äúgood‚Äù by his standards cause he‚Äôs cashing a check. I‚Äôm not a Lakers fan but this is embarrassing to the sport.

EDIT: Regarding the last play, I was so hung up on the shot selection, it didn‚Äôt even compute with me the worst thing about that play. Why the hell did he shoot it so early in the clock? You‚Äôre up 1 and you need to run the clock out before scoring again but no, about 5 seconds into the shot clock you‚Äôre chucking a contested 2? That‚Äôs peak tank right there.",0.93
