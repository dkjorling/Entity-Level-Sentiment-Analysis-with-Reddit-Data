4,2022-11-09 04:48:37,yq8wap,Neither going all in or a rebuild is the right move. $35m in cap space over the summer to build depth around AD and LeBron.,CutLonzosHair2017,"Yes, this year is wasted. But it was wasted once they traded for Westbrook. No point in chasing a lost cause. Which I think is obvious to most people. But what isn't is a rebuild makes no sense either. The most valuable asset in a rebuild is having control of your own pick. We do not have that until 2025 at the earliest. So even trading AD and even LeBron would just put us in limbo of mediocre draft picks until we would be able to take advantage of tanking in 2025. 

Best course of action would be to hope AD and LeBron don't age out too fast and rebuild around them with actual starter quality NBA players instead of a hodgepodge of minimum contract players struggling to be in the league.",1.0

Post Nash / Howard disaster, still was willing to watch Kobe in his twilight, at least that was fun.

Last year I was willing to watch almost every game because I held onto hope that we could squeeze into the playoffs. Joke was on me obviously. 

The point is I feel like i can tell myself honestly that i appreciate this team for the reasons you're ""supposed to"". Except now. We fucking suck and it sounds like everyone in the organization has just accepted that already. I'm not going to give my time and energy to watching us eat ass.

14,2022-11-09 01:41:03,yq51t5,The Lakers might turn into the Knicks.,Kanajeji,"The Knicks, known as the Mecca of Basketball have been the subject of much ridicule in the sport. One of the largest franchises in the NBA is perhaps the largest market in the sport was ruined by the fecklessness of it's ownership. The Lakers might be headed in a similar direction with the way things are headed. 

The team which has historically held much appeal for basketball superstars due to it's history and the vibrancy of the city is based in has been subject to gross mismanagement. Ruining this current superstar talent and refusal to do anything to fix things will sway any future superstar from the team, especially with the Clippers being in much better hands and being nurtured by a passionate owner with an unlimited treasure trove to offer them the best of both worlds. 

The only positive for this organization is the great scouting department with an eye for talent. But even then, drafting without the ability to attract superstars is not a recipe for the consistent success a franchise like Lakers demands. Surely the front office understand this no?",1.0

16,2022-11-09 01:12:59,yq4g4u,Has father time caught up to LeBron? Comparing his stats to the start of last season,imadogg,"If yall have been on twitter, r/nba, this sub, etc etc you'd have seen the nonstop talk of Lebron literally being 55 years old and/or dead.

# There's been numerous comparisons to last season's Bron and his seemingly steep decline this year. For a refresher, highlights of last year:

* 30.3ppg - 2nd best of his entire career, first time surpassing 30ppg in 14 seasons
* 52.4%fg - 6th best of his career, best of his Lakers career
* 35.9% from 3 - 6th best of his career vs 62% from 2 - 2nd best of his career. 75.6%ft which is his 5th best
* Overall stats of 30/8/6/1/1 which is wild overall... but psycho for a guy in his age 37 season

# How's he doing this year? In 9 games played out of 10 possible so far:

* 24.3ppg - 2nd worst of his career - only rookie season was worse
* 44.7%fg - see above. Worst since rookie year
* 21% from 3 - by far his worst ever. His 55.6% from 2 is in the middle, and 68.2%ft is 3rd worst ever
* Overall stats of 24/9/7/1/1 which is still respectable overall. But that efficiency is rough

# Now that that's out of the way, lets take a look at how Bron started last season. Stats for his first 9 games:

* Did not play in his 9th game of the season until the Lakers' 20th game. 9/20 gp vs 9/10 games this year.
* Stats of 24.6/5/6.1 last season vs 24.3/8.9/7.1 this season
* Splits of 48.3%/36.6%/79.4% last season vs 44.7/21%/68.2% this year

# So... is Lebron dead?

Possibly, possibly not. Time catches up to us all. 

But he started last year with similar/worse counting stats, and more injured when compared to this season. 

The biggest thing is his *putrid* shooting this season. If he can even get his 3% up to a *crappy* 30.5% and his ft up to a *meh* 70%, all of a sudden we're at 26.5ppg on 48% shooting. It would be unprecedented for shooting out of all things to permanently fall off a cliff like this, so I'd bet on that normalizing a bit. 

Hopefully we can stop freaking out about father time killing off Bron. Though the Lakers still suck ass unfortunately.",1.0

24,2022-11-08 22:56:33,yq1bs6,[OC] Reason to be Optimistic this Season (Even with a 2-8 record),regnard,"I know things are not looking good for the Lakers so far with injuries, an inexplicable team-wide shooting slump, and questionable roster construction contributing to losses. 

But there‚Äôs a few reason to be optimistic.

- *Lonnie Walker IV* - As much as we harp on Lonnie‚Äôs play, he is actually setting career high marks on PER, BPM, and WS/48. This tells me he is developing under Darvin Ham. 
- *Westbench* - WB is in the late Bill Walton stage of his career (former MVP turned super sub). He can yield a good return from a tanking team like the Hornets or the Pistons. I could see him returning to OKC. That said, this is turning out to be a good bounce back season for him.
-  *Player Development* - In my opinion, we have 3 role payers that we must bring back next season: Austin Reaves, Wenyen Gabriel, and Troy Brown, Jr. These guys are improving and  going to to be key rotation players.
- *LeBron‚Äôs Milestone* - If this team peaks as a play-in tournament squad, then the highlight for the season would be LeBron passing Kareem. Last season, there was some jump in his scoring around the All-Star break.

The season is still early and I think the team should pick up a couple wins that will boost fan optimism.",1.0
