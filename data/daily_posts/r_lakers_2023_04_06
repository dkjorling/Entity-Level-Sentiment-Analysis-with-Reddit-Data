They could definitely win those two games, meaning we would also have to win our last two games for them to not surpass us. 

Anything can happen in the play-in since it‚Äôs one game elimination. I would therefore much rather play at home in a play-in game. Unfortunately, getting the 6th seed seems to be out of reach since Warriors would have to lose at least 1 of their remaining two games which are against the Kings and Blazers who‚Äôre both resting all their players.",1.0

As someone whose seen most of his games the last 5-6 years, I wanted to highlight a key, positive detail that I have not yet seen mentioned: the distance of his 3 pt shots

To me, one indication of where lebron is at physically is the distance at which he attempts his 3s. For instance, post Solomon hill, it feels we‚Äôve seen far less of the ‚ÄúLeLogo‚Äù shots that we saw in 2019-2020. Part of this is age, but part of this is where his body is at.

Last night, not only did he make a few, but he was bombing away. The one he hit early in the 3rd quarter was the type that really opens the eyes. I would encourage everyone to watch his highlights and take note of this point.

So yes there was a lot wrong in the game - much of which is tied to brons first half - but this is a small but important silver lining and positive takeaway to keep in mind",1.0

AD gets doubled on the mid block / mid range area which is the worst place to get doubled. He'll pass it out to the 3pt line to make the right play but because of where he generally is, it's much easier for the defense to rotate out and prevent and open shot. Compare this to a KD or Curry, players who would get doubled above the 3pt line where rotating over is much, much harder and a pass to a open shot is much easier.   
Each time he wasn't doubled he took a shot or made a play. I'm not making excuses, I'm just saying it's up to Ham to really try and turn a double into a real advantage rather than what happens now (just lose time on the shot clock).  Not a fan Ham with his lineups and play calls btw.

50,2023-04-06 09:19:05,12dedeo,Stay positive Laker fans,ThunderClown101,"The Lakers have ended the road-trip with a 4-1 record. 

They lost the only game they should have lost. A final game of a road-trip, third game in four nights and a second night of a B2B against a Clippers team who had 3 days of rest. 

Still, the whole squad came in, competed and went home HEALTHY after playing 3 games in 4 nights. 

What did the Clippers do with this game? They secured the 5th seed most likely. 

The Lakers have 2 more games to play and they are favored in both of them.

The Phoenix Suns will be playing against us on a second night of a back to back. They already have the 4th seed locked up and there is no incentive for them to go hard on Friday.

Then the Lakers play the Jazz at home. They should take care of their business.

So best case scenario - the Lakers win the remaining games, the Warriors lose to the Kings tomorrow and the Lakers get that sweet 6th seed. 

Worst case scenario - the Lakers lose out, Warriors win their 2 games and the Lakers face off against the Pelicans in the play-in for that 7th spot. 

No matter what happens, if they make the playoffs, the Lakers will not face the Suns, the Clippers or the Nuggets in the first 2 rounds. 

Stay positive and appreciate what the Lakers have done in the last 25 games. 

Respect to the guys for coming out last night fighting and uphill battle despite the fatigue.",1.0
