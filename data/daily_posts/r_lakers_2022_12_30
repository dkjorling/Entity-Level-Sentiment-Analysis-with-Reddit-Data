0,2022-12-31 07:09:20,zzo621,Two Trades I still think are very possible and give the Lakers a legit shot at a championship (assuming AD returns and we make the playoffs),BBaron08,"1. RWB &amp; 2027 1st for Myles Turner &amp; Buddy Hield. We can throw in a 2nd if we need. 

Why do the Lakers do it? 

If our front office has learned anything at all, anything, we cannot continue AD at the 5 for long stretches. He is an absolute monster, but fragile and we need to accept that. He has openly stated he likes playing the 4. Just like in 2020, we absolutely abused teams with McGee &amp; Howard at Center and AD at the 4. Turner gives us a shot blocker in the paint and allows AD to play free safety as he did in 2020 and save his body a bit along with not having to be our sole paint presence on defense. Myles is also shooting 40%+ from 3 this year. He isn't some knock down shooter, good enough to where he won't totally clog the paint. Buddy Hield is a top 5 shooter in the game. An absolute traffic cone on defense, but again, adding Turner in my mind is a net positive on defense. Buddy is probably the best floor spacer we can add to our roster. 

Why do the Pacers do it?

Simple. You cannot lose Turner for nothing in free agency. In my mind a Lakers 2027 1st has serious value. In 5 years time, our beloved Bron will be 43 and AD will be 34. Nobody knows what will happen but good chance we will be in a re-tool phase ourselves so the Pacers may end up with a lottery pick here. They also get a massive expiring in WB, and can free up major cap in 2023 as they continue to build around Mathurin and Halliburton. Turner also practically posted on twitter for us to trade for him. If he can play his cards right again, and force the Pacers hand maybe we can get away without giving up a ton.

2. Nunn &amp; 2029 1st for Saddiq Bey

I know the focus has been on Bogi, but apparently Bey may be coming available in trade talks. If he does become available, he is the perfect wing, and per Jake Fischer, the Pistons want an unprotected 1st. I would try and add top 5 protections. He's 23, plays solid D and can score in bunches. At 6'8, if we do the Turner trade, our potential starting line-up goes to:

LBJ, Hield, Bey, AD, Turner. We go from midgets to monsters as we were in 2020.",1.0

Lonnie is getting paid $6 million. He's far surpassed the value of his contract.

Same for Reaves, Troy Brown, Thomas Bryant, Dennis Schroder, etc., These are vet minimum guys but ya'll are expecting them to play like they are max contract players.

The fact is, the only way this Lakers team can get better right now is by trading Russ and one or two first rounders. Expecting vet mins to play like All-Stars won't happen so why even complain about it?",0.86

But they wouldn‚Äôt make any panic moves. 

They would understand that there is only one goal in mind - revamp the roster for 2023-2024. 

And the best way to do it is to see what is the best available deal at the trade deadline. 

So let‚Äôs not panic and beg Pelinka to make an immediate trade to make the play-in with AD on the bench. 

Let‚Äôs be patient and if no move is made by trade deadline hope that LeBron and AD request trades because they need to be saved from this organization who is wasting their careers to sell tickets.
