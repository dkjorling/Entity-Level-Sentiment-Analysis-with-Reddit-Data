6,2022-12-14 06:49:40,zlk1ov,"Yes, Russell Westbrook still needs to be moved.",tsesarevichalexei,"The fact that he hasn‚Äôt been at unmitigated disaster this season has given a lot of people the wrong idea about Westbrook this season.

A lot of people are acting like he‚Äôs this indispensable key to winning all of the sudden.

This, as the title implies, is an absurd notion.

Yes, he‚Äôs been better.

Yes, he deserves credit for being a pro this season. 

Yes, he has had spurts of absolute brilliance.

However, as we, once again, saw tonight, he‚Äôs way too erratic. One quarter, he‚Äôs brilliant. The other, he‚Äôs a disaster again. Hell, just look at this OT for Christ‚Äôs sake. Started off incredible, only to once again become a liability when it matters most. In case y‚Äôall forgot, him being left open in the clutch is exactly how he‚Äôs been exposed time and time again in the playoffs (including by us back in 2020, might I add!).

Now, if the dude was making $10-15 mil (like the average 6th man), I could live with it. However, at $47 mil, that fact is just crushing for us. We can‚Äôt being paying that much money to one guy who can‚Äôt depended on in the most important moments. 

This is something that also makes meaningfully upgrading this team damn-near impossible. I agree that trading Beverly and Nunn should be the priority. However, that one trade, which would realistically yield us one player (probably), considering the org.‚Äôs aversion to luxury tax and the desire of other teams to fleece us if multiple players are involved, won‚Äôt save us. We still need multiple role players back, and the only realistic pathway to doing that still is via a Russell Westbrook trade. It‚Äôs mathematically impossible any other way.",1.0

They just need someone to give them 10-15 minutes a night, a real NBA player. Why would Pistons trade with Lakers right now, how is it in their best interest at all?? 

It‚Äôs just so obvious that everyone wants to prey on us, but how can you blame them.. we are in such a shitty spot. However, if we don‚Äôt stack wins in the month of December, the FO will have every reason to throw the season away at that point. A trade moving a first in Jan/Feb, with a bad record WOULDNT make sense. 

Just have to make a small move right now and give us any resemblance of depth. Maybe a second PF behind LeBron, he needs rest too. ANYTHING will be better than Nunn

Edit:: I just wanna add.. with a roster that lacks depth, it really hurt us to be missing Wenyen, and having whiffed so hard on JTA.. i would play Max every chance I get, instead of FUCKING NUNN",0.77
9,2022-12-14 06:17:30,zljhok,There‚Äôs a fundamental problem here that we need to address,kronos9797,"This game sucked. I was ready to give up hope and was absolutely amazed at how we got ahead by 13 in the 4th there. AD missed free throws, LeBron hoisted 3s but I think the crucial point here is AD had to play the entire second half and Lebron was out for like all but 4 mins.

That‚Äôs not normal, those are playoff minutes and there‚Äôs a reason why playoff basketball is a different beast. Asking a 38 year old LeBron to score every single trip down the end and asking AD to give his all on offense and defense is just unrealistic and not sustainable. We need role players to step up, heck even Boston required shots from both Williams and Smart (role players) to survive tonight.

There‚Äôs 3 plays I feel that had it gone our way might have definitely helped. There‚Äôs the 2 point gift off the inbound to Marcus Smart. The opportune 3 point play in the fast break where Lebron was right at the rim and had it been counted extended our lead in the dying moments. Instead he missed the and-1 bucket and made only 1-2 FTs (so potential 1 point out of 3). And obviously the 2 missed FTs by AD and believe you me, I‚Äôm sure he doesn‚Äôt care one bit about his total points etc and is just as mad at himself as us.

Now I‚Äôm not trying to come here to defend LeBron and AD. If anything what I‚Äôm trying to say is come playoff time, I have 100% belief that they will be killing it night in night out. Today showed us that they go toe to toe for the best 1-2 punches with any duo in the league. The problem is the rest of our roster is just so so bad that them being great doesn‚Äôt make up the difference. 

Sure we might win a few close games by asking them to play like their playoff selves but that‚Äôs just not sustainable. We need roster reinforcements, we need them soon if we have to salvage anything this season. 

Side note: I don‚Äôt know if the Stepien rule applies for second round picks but if it doesn‚Äôt I would trade every single second round pick for the rest of the decade to get both Bogdanovic and another defensive wing to us. We‚Äôve already seen these picks can be bought so I really don‚Äôt see the reasoning behind not offering more second round picks if they help move the needle.",0.71

Our roster sure sucked but that doesn't give reason to always play those three guys at the same time. Insert Nunn also. 

Usage of timeouts has been horrible for Coach Ham. Didn't call a timeout in their last possession. No rest for LBJ and AD when they are up big. I know this loss is on everyone. I hope AD is okay mentally. Dude missing game sealing FTs in two games is really hard.",1.0

I really don‚Äôt understand anymore - the lakers are not far off. Just legit get a few rotation level players and that‚Äôs probably a handful of wins right there.

60,2022-12-14 02:05:33,zlec4t,Dennis Schroder trade ideas?,TorontoRaptors34,"Personally what I think they should do is try to ship him and a 2nd round pick with Dame Jones to pistons see if you can get Alec Burks as well as Isiah Livers two solid replacement players. If u give Mo Town some 2nds along with a solid player and a big they can kinda develop with small upside I can see Detroit taking it even though it doesn't look too appeasing at first. 

Personally, I know many have talked about Bev Nunn JTA Dame as guys to give up but ion see why Dennis is left out the picture. When you look at his play he by no means is bad but doesn't do a whole lot to help the team either. Sure he doesn't turn the ball over a whole lot and plays kinda moderate speed wise but those are kinda the bare minimum. He is a solid defender but he isn't great either and doesn't do anything to move the needle. You got LeBron James and Russell Westbrook who are the best in the business at doing that and have HOF careers because of it. Why would u need handlers. Not to mention Dennis doens't really feed AD the ball either. He also I feel kinda gets in the way of Lonnie at times. 

With that being said he is a solid pg that can help a flurry of teams around the league that could get u back something like an Alec Burks or even in Houston with Garrison Mathews who isn't really valued a whole lot. 

While many have talked about Bev's struggles I feel he is too important to the team to get rid of as far as being a glue guy. While he isn't a lot on offense he has been imporving slightly and if u get rid of Dennis Nunn Dame and JTA for some wings I mentioned above like Cam, Burks, Livers, and maybe Garrison Mathews. Bev can be unleashed as a pure irritant in spot minutes.",1.0

Me and a couple buddies are looking to go to our first Lakers game this January when we visit LA. Do most games often sell out? We were trying to watch them vs Mavs, so i‚Äôm paying attention to the ticket prices atm. Also how‚Äôs the view from the balconies? Any tips/advice is appreciated.",1.0

67,2022-12-13 21:52:31,zl85i1,The Lakers should only trade Pat Bev if they can get a 2 way wing. Trading away your best perimeter defender for a one dimensional defensive liability type player is not a good idea.,blacPanther55,Trading away Pat Bev for a Bojan or Fourier type player would drastically hurt the defense. They should only move him for a 2 way wing like Kuz or John Collins or a center such as Myles Turner or Mo Bamba. The team should be focusing only wings such as Jaden McDaniels and Cam Reddish that could possibly  be had for Nunn and picks.,1.0
68,2022-12-13 21:13:58,zl75cz,Why don‚Äôt we go for Gary Harris?,1of1czr,"Everyone‚Äôs infatuated right now with Bojan and while he would be an upgrade offensively he‚Äôs trash at defense and past him prime only going to decline. AND he‚Äôs on contract for more than a year when we should be looking for expirings to free up cap to resign Lonnie &amp; make more moves. Trading for bojan limits our flexibility next year and it ain‚Äôt worth it tbh he isn‚Äôt a player that‚Äôll take us from what we are into title favorites. I like Gary Harris and think he would be a good fit for us, he‚Äôs off the books next year and Orlando shouldn‚Äôt be looking for too much to take him off their hands. Nunn &amp; a second or something similar should atleast be thrown on the table. Other options are Terence Ross, Cam Reddish, Jae Crowder etc",1.0
