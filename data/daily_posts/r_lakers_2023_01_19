4,2023-01-19 23:48:40,10gh7rf,Anyone see some similarities in TB and Clint Capella?,TorontoRaptors34,"In a sense I feel that TB should be better on defense he has the quickness on offense and he has great hands being able to catch the wildest passes and is lethal when fed on offense. I think the next step for him is to get better on defense. When you look at his body type and structure it reminds me of Clint Capella in a sense. Capella has been an elite rim protector for a the past few yrs dating back to his time in Houston. Bryant is 6""10 with a 7'6 wingspan so you'd think he'd have potential to be an elite two way big who can be great on offense as well as swat shots out the building with his long arms. But for some reason his moter on defense isn't what it should be it looks like he's slow on that end and is easy able to cross up if switched. When he faced elite bigs he gets cooked. Personally, I think it shouldn't be right to judge him completely until he gets with AD in the starting line up and gets to show his full potential as a BIG. Given how quick of a decision maker he is on the offensive side I think he can be a great supporter for him even if he not the best on D he can be a good help defender given AD is a beast on defense. He tries hard as hell its just that his mechanics to me aren't where they need to be. Maybe it will improve throughout the season. 

IMO a prime Thomas Bryant is a better Clint Capella with more of an actual offensive skill set coupled with elite shot blocking ability.",1.0

8,2023-01-19 20:25:08,10gc6vz,Reaves should be closing games!,Alarming_Worth_8506,He is a great closer. The Lakers need to trust him more in late game situations. Lakers could also help him by paying for a couple baddies from LA court side. Then it's game over and lakers will win the finals very easily. Make it happen Jeanie. I'm sure paying a couple baddies to sit court side so reaves goes off will be cheaper then actually putting together a championship team AND guess what üòä if you just hire the baddies and don't go after some decent players you will stay under the repeater tax yayyyyyyyyyy,1.0

10,2023-01-19 17:21:37,10g7erq,No more Westbrook hate,Thechosenone23x6,Westbrook is a real one Clutch last night coach is using him the best way possible and he is embracing it. No trades are going to be made. The real person we should be pissed at is JEANIE BUSS. She should be ashamed of herself. She is crossing klutch now and you don‚Äôt want to do that other stars are watching. If I where lebron I‚Äôd brake the record and just sell f*** it rest up for next year on real team because klutch will force him outta here and leave the lakers in the SHITTER. Good work Jeanie buss hope that 8th grade prospect works out for you,1.0
11,2023-01-19 17:20:49,10g7dzz,LeBron runs out of gas down the stretch trying to keep the starting lineup afloat.,Early-Candidate5492,"To start the game and the 3rd quarter he has to scratch 10 points each stint because no one else can score the ball.

If Schroder isn't agressive he's basically pointless and that's when he needs to be agressive. Dribbling the ball up the floor passing it and running to the corner is pointless.",1.0

He looks like a good man's coach as he is getting the team to be competitive and the players to play hard. But clearly we lost at least 5 games with his bad tactics/coaching in the closing minutes. Even with the injuries, I think this is a .5 team, even before a trade and can be much better if fully fit or some good trades.",1.0

Do we have anyone on our staff that knows basic fundamental X's and O's basketball? Simple concepts like ""movement"", ""in bounds plays"", ""time outs"" and ""end of game strategy""?   
Our end of game/half possessions look like when I coached my little kids: Give the ball to one guy and get out of his way, hope it goes in. I can watch any NCAA game, at any level and see better drawn up plays and offensive sets. I imagine we pay our assistant coaches poorly, but for fuck's sake, doesn't seem there's one person on that bench that does anything, certainly not helping out a rookie head coach who appears lost AF.",1.0

Possible pieces that have been on the block for a while:

-Conley: great facilitator which would help Lebron and AD tremendously. 

-M. Beasley: another scorer who is consistent. 

-J. Vanderbilt: an energy guy who can score and do a lot of other things. 

-J Collins: expensive but a contributor 

Lakers GM sucks. This is the worst executive team I‚Äôve seen in a while. I would be firing them about now.",1.0
