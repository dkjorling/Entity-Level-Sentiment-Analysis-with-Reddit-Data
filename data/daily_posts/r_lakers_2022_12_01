1,2022-12-02 01:01:39,za68qb,"Over our first 10 games we were 29th in the NBA by Net Rating (-7.9). Over our last 10 games, we are the 5th (+5.6). This is by far the biggest swing out of all 30 teams, so which version of the team is closer to reality?",G0ATJAMES,"[source](https://www.nba.com/stats/teams/traditional?DateFrom=11/08/2022&amp;DateTo=12/07/2022&amp;dir=A&amp;sort=PLUS_MINUS)

Comparing the first half of our season so far, to the 2nd half: **none** of the bottom 5 teams in Net Rating have changed, **except for LAL**  who shot up from 29th to 5th. 

It's tempting to say that we're somewhere in the middle, especially given the strength of schedule. If that's the case, we are sitting at around -1.1 pts per 100 possessions which is actually a pretty big upgrade from last year, and probably means we're a playoff team.

That said, a lot of the numbers from those first 10 games actually seem less sustainable than the last 10 games - particularly: 3P% (30th), Fouls Drawn (24th), Offensive Rebounds (23rd). 

On the flip side, not much from our last 10 games seem all that unsustainable other than an easier schedule. What do you all think?",1.0

Obviously, the Lakers always seems to find themselves ‚Äòinterested‚Äô in basically everyone, so take it for what it‚Äôs worth. 

Indy- Buddy, Turner
Jazz- Clarkson, Conley, Beasley
Spurs- Richardson, Poeltl, McBuckets
Bulls- Vucevic, Derozan
Rockets- Gordon, Harkless
Heat- Lowry, Strus
Knicks- Rose, Reddish, Fournier
Hornets- Hayward, Rozier, Plumlee
Nets- Kyrie, Harris, Curry, Mills
Magic- Bamba, Ross

Some of these players could probably be acquired for cheap, others will require unloading the ‚Äò27+‚Äô29 FRP‚Äôs.

21,2022-12-01 14:47:36,z9ppai,It's ok to criticize LeBron,Fulmizant,"LeBron played how the critics have been wanting him to play. He took shots in rhythm, skipped the ball out to the perimeter quickly, and looked to attack quickly; and fed AD when the defense collapsed. If you've been watching all year, he wasn't playing like this;  he was holding the ball in the midpost or on the wing. Real Lakers fans just want the team to play better and part of that is being realistic about when the stars aren't playing the right way. Westbrook had to come off the bench, AD had to stop posting up and shooting jumpers; and now Bron had to be more decisive. Hopefully they stay consistent and we get to the playoffs",1.0

Russ, Pat Bev, Dennis, Reaves and I think Thomas Bryant. Guess what? It was shit.

Hopefully that was just an emergency thing and not some knew lineup experiment.  


I did like seeing LBJ, AD, Bryant, and Reaves on the floor together. Play whichever PG has the hot hand at that point. Want to see more of this for sure.",1.0
