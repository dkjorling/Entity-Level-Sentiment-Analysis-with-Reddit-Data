lakers getting the 4th pick with rumors of AD interested in joining them and the pelicans wanting picks to trade him was *very* predictable.

  Lose CP3, draft AD. Lose AD, draft Zion. 

 

Ewing wing frozen/folded envelope. That year the audit company that's forever audited the draft, their parent company had something like 80% ownership in MSG.

2010 - Wizards owner had just died, and the league wanted to get past the Arenas gun drama ASAP. Wizards move up from 4th to 1st to draft John Wall.

2012 - Pelicans had just been bought and relocated to New Orleans, so the league rigged it to give them an instant superstar in AD to jumpstart the team and create a solid fanbase in New Orleans.

2010 through 2014 - LeBron left for Miami and the Cavs then get the #1 pick three out of four years because the league felt bad for the Cavs and didn't want them to fall into utter mediocrity, OR they knew LeBron would one day return and wanted them to have tons of trade bait.

Since around 2020 or 2021 LeBron has been very outspoken and the loudest voice in the league about how he feels negatively when it comes to the police due to some brutality happening around America. Some people may know this but cops or former cops have a real hobby of reffing basketball games in their spare time 

A lot of these NBA refs are older men who lean right wing ([Former NBA refs claim they were fired for COVID vax refusal, allege 'jab or job ultimatum'])(https://www.foxnews.com/sports/former-nba-refs-claim-they-were-fired-covid-vax-refusal-allege-jab-job-ultimatum.amp) so LeBron being outspoken negatively about the police/left wing ideals is basically a big fuck you too these guys, they take it as disrespect and you know how much the right wing hates LeBron

Not trying to start some political war here I just I feel this has affected LeBron/The Lakers whistle a lot.
