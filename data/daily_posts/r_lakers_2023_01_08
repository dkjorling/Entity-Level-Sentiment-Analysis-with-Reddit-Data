Blazers already lost today. Jazz are down 10+ at the half. All we need is for Houston to beat the wolves and this past week will have gone the best it could have.",1.0

9,2023-01-08 19:16:41,106rj17,Are we still interested in trading Russ?,AllTheMedicine,"As we've seen recently, Russ has been an assist machine + some decent scoring. Still not high on him personally but I can admit he's been good lately.

That said, would you guys still trade him if a decent package came up? I know next season, we have 30-something mill in cap space but we'll need to sign role players, while if we trade Russ this season, we can get more out of it this season.

So, just trying to hear opinions, do ya'll think Russ will stay consistent enough be useful the rest of the season/playoffs or should he still be traded regardless of good recent play?",0.5
