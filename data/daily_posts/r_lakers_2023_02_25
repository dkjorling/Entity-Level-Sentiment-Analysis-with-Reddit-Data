1,2023-02-26 05:56:33,11c6t2z,Looking for Tickets.,omair1012,Hey guys! I wanna take my son to a Laker game. Probably to the Raptors Vs Lakers on March 10th. Before buying on any website I wanted to check here first if anyone has any for sale. I wanna try and be as close to the floor as possible. Looking at $300-$400 per ticket. Thanks!,1.0

But lately, I've seen him play and he plays two-way and has a killer mentality. I know a lot of people think it's cringe how much he wants to be like Kobe, but he is backing it up at this point and especially if he makes it to the finals again. Lakers should be looking into ways to get him to come to the team tbh. What do you guys think?",1.0
