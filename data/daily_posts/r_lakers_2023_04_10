10,2023-04-11 03:53:40,12i7hsi,Easiest way to win the season?,wbgoat009,"#Play-In 
- We easily beat the Wolves tomorrow, their team is a disaster right now and we have Dennis coming back and a center to help AD. Then the Wolves get eliminated by OKC/Pelicans. 

#Play Offs 
- We go up against the Grizzlies, they don't have Steven Adams so we should have an advantage over them, I'm guessing we'll go like 4-1 or 4-2. 

From there the Media will start going nuts on how the Lakers beat the 2nd seed team in the West and more attention and pressure will be put on Lakers and Bron. 

- I think the Warriors will destroy the Kings so we'll play Warriors next. This will be very challenging as the Warriors will have Wiggins back but we were like 3-1 with the Warriors this season, I think we can pull it off 4-3. Flightreactz goes apeshit.

- After all that we will go against the Suns or Clippers or Nuggets (sorry Pelicans/OKC) if we play Suns or Clippers I think we get eliminated so we should root for the Nuggets. If we play Nuggets I truly believe we can destroy them
4-1 or even 4-0. 

- Now Lakers make it to the final and I could see them going up against either Celtics, Bucks or 76ers. If it's Celtics or Bucks we lose but if 76ers somehow make it to the final, we win. 

- Lebron gets his 5th ring, AD gets his respect, Darvin Ham gets praise from the media for being a rookie coach, Russ &amp; Pat Bev get their first rings, giant parade at Crypto Arena. The End",1.0

I see a lot of y‚Äôall in this sub rn trash talking saying this gonna be an easy win and laughing at how stupid the wolves are. 

We should still win this game, but to be honest, we haven‚Äôt looked great these last 4 games. AD hasn‚Äôt been himself for any of those games and scored over 20 only once. We went 3-1 in those games but we played 3 g league teams and played close games with all of them. If we play like we‚Äòve played these last few games, things won‚Äôt go our way and we need this win. The team clearly has some dead legs and need some rest.

Minnesota are also still a good team, they just beat the pels despite all the drama that happened in that game. Ant is a stud and he can go off any night, KAT seems to be back in the swing of things and the Wolves have honestly been playing much better without Gobert and their offense actually looks real solid. 

We have to come into his game with the right mindset and crush these guys! If we go in thinking this is gonna be easy, we‚Äôre gonna lose, it‚Äôs a simple as that. I wouldn‚Äôt count the Wolves out just yet, but if we go out there with the right mentality and mindset, the sky is the limit. Go Lakers!",1.0

For everyone else...

How do we feel about the Lakers right now?

A - With Bron, even at his advanced age, when he's on a decent team and the key players are healthy, a deep post season run should always be expected. After all, the man has led his squads to 10 Finals, including 8 in a row (for two different teams). They could win it all this year if they just stay healthy.

B - If they pass the play-in and win the first round, they will have revealed themselves as true contenders who get stronger every round. Along with the Warriors, they are the scariest team in the playoffs.

C - This team, after the Westbrook trade, does indeed have enough to win it all. However, they need a full season to develop chemistry first. They will likely have an early exit.

D - Sadly, I can't imagine AD staying healthy throughout the entire playoffs. I feel like his body is broken down, and he's always on the precipice of missing a few weeks. Due to that, they can't go far.

E - Other.

Personally, I'm pretty hopeful. I'm leaning (A) or (B), but could cope with (C).",1.0

50,2023-04-10 12:42:38,12hho5y,How to bypass League Pass Geo-blocking + Avoid Local Blackouts,HammyC," 

Attention NBA fans! Want to catch all the action of the NBA League Pass without having to worry about local blackouts? Well, we‚Äôve got you covered! In this guide, we will show you how to successfully get League Pass working with VPN and blackout games.

Step-by-Step Guide:

1. Purchase an international NBA League Pass subscription with VPN enabled. We recommend using India as a location, which will cost you less than $19 a year. If your VPN has trouble connecting to India, you can try connecting to Mongolia or Turkey. It will cost you around $40ish dollars for a year of LP.
2. Install Location Guard, an extension available for some supported browsers.
3. Set your **FIXED LOCATION** to anywhere outside the blackout area. It doesn't matter where you choose, but we recommend Mumbai, India. Make sure that your default level is set to ""use fixed location"".
4. Sign out of NBA.com and clear out your NBA.com cookies. You can do this by going to the settings for your browser and searching ""cookies"". Then, delete all your cookies or search for ""NBA"" and just delete everything from NBA.com.
5. Log in to your NBA account with both Location Guard and VPN enabled. The location doesn't have to be the same as your purchased LP. As long as it is out of the blackout area, you can connect to any location outside the blackout area. If you're having trouble connecting to India VPN, you can just connect to Mexico or another location instead.
6. DISABLE YOUR VPN AFTER YOU SUCCESSFULLY LOG IN. THE VIDEO PLAYER WILL NOT LOAD WITH VPN ACTIVE.
7. With Location Guard enabled, you can now watch all non-blackout NBA games! Enjoy all the action of the NBA League Pass without worrying about local blackouts.

FYI: I'm using NordVPN personally and I got my VPN on a Discount from this [**Community Website**](https://www.vpngrades.com/)**.**
