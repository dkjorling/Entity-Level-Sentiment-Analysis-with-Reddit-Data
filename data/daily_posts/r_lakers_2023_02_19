3,2023-02-20 03:55:59,116x0y0,Alright I’m freaking out about Bron,suhar97,"What the literal fuck man? How does this shit keep happening to us? It’s like on any given day you can flip a coin and bet heads as Bron gets hurt and tails as AD gets hurt

The bad luck is just ridiculous and also why the f is Bron going for chase downs in the ASG??? I really wish he had taken the Giannis route and just sat after 1-2 dunks and called it a day 

Am I the only one freaking about this?",1.0

That would’ve been a ROBBERY for Toronto and now it’s looking like his days of being a championship pg are long gone. And we even got something of value for Pat Bev (THT &lt; Pat Bev &lt; Mo Bamba),1.0
