Put in the gunners. It's just like how Matt Ryan was put in last time.

Schroeder was broke this game. Just bench him. Troy was running cold.

Westbrook was hot üî•.

Lineup should've been: LeBron Wenyen Russ Swider Christie/Bryant

I would've loved to see any of those 5 shoot it. Just because they are on the bench doesn't mean they are cold. These guys work hard everyday and stay ready. They would shoot the same shot in any game situation",1.0
