3,2023-03-06 05:44:35,11jpvk2,I know he's in a different role with different pieces around him but russ really shot like he didnt care with us while he's being smarter on the clippers,utrid_son_of_utrif,"Watched this game and a few others when he signed with them and honestly why does it look like he's been smarter with his shot selections and passes. He occasionally does russ type TOs but he's been relatively good. Not as many TOs and stupid shots taken. 


He looked like he really wanted to win and while im not completely saying that wasnt the case when he was with us, he often just wanted to control the game and take 'that' shot at the end. He differs to PG and leonard towards the end of the game and sits back meanwhile here you see him shooting random jumpshots and 3s at the end of the game with us

I know he's not with us and we shouldnt really talk about him anymore but he really could have been like he is right now with us.",1.0

6,2023-03-06 04:49:40,11jorij,My evaluation of Rui Hachimura so far,denobino,"Things he's already decent at

\- Midrange \[Season average 49.6% 113 attempts\]  
\- Corner threes \[Season average 47.6% 42 attempts\]  
\- Can spread the floor from the midrange area \[especially elbow\] and corner.  
\- Decent hustle.  


Things he can work on  
\- Defensive consistency. (He will go on stretches of playing outstanding defense and all of the sudden not).  
\- Needs to work on his finishing. He is athletic but his moves are stiff in general. He has the body to be a better finisher at the rim.   
\- Lateral quickness can use some work. This will also help him to be a better defender.  
\- He needs to be more aggressive with the ball. His play style is really passive from what I've seen. He mostly relies on his footwork to get to the spot he wants. But he has an NBA-ready body that he's not using to its full potential. This goes for both ends of the floor.   
\- Be a better threat at the dunker spot.  


I am a big Rui fan and I want to see him succeed. I truly think he can be an outstanding role player on the Lakers going forward given the right guidance, training, and coaching. I don't think we've seen enough of him to come to conclusion about him just yet.",1.0

75,2023-03-05 09:42:39,11it3gi,We need to accept the reality of this season,Vegetable_Bank9063,"Scrolling through Lakers Reddit every day is wildly entertaining. Not only is our online fan base super bi-polar, but you also RARELY see realistic takes.

Here‚Äôs my realistic theory, that COULD be wrong, but is in the ballpark of our reality‚Ä¶

Lakers skid into the Play-in as the nine seed. Utah and NO continue to slide, and the Lakers scrape together a couple of wins to push in front of them. LeBron returns with 4-5 games left in the regular season to try and get into a rhythm. 

For the play-in, Zion has recently returned, so the Lakers play the Pels at home. Zion dominates, but Dlo has mismatches all game and uses them to feed AD and Bron all game. Lakers W.

Lakers then play Dallas in Dallas for the 8-seed. Luka gets gassed when it matters most, and the Lakers run away in the 4th. 

First round against the Nuggets, and everyone is predicting that the lakers will take the series since theyare such a dangerous 8-seed. But with the lack of experience since Lebron‚Äôs return, Jokic picks our defense apart and Ham makes no creditable lineup adjustments. Lakers get taken down in 6.

And this is OKAY. If our team gets 8 playoff games together I feel really good about our chances next year. I HOPE I‚Äôm wrong, but this is the most realistic outcome.
