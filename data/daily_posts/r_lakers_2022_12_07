1,2022-12-08 04:39:47,zfp5iy,"Trading 1 pick is a half measure - either push the chips in or ride it out, but do not straddle the fence and try to do both at once",suhar97,"The truth of the matter with this team is that if they want to do anything then they will have to move both picks this year. There‚Äôs plenty of posts around why they should go all in (i.e., an open western conference, AD playing mvp quality ball, lebron still capable of producing when healthy).

If you make one smaller deal, the ceiling of the team marginally improves. Yes, they will probably comfortably get into play in range or, in an upside case, crack the top 6. 

The issue is from there - then what? So long as Russ‚Äô contract is on the books, this team‚Äôs ceiling will forever be capped. He‚Äôs been great this year, but his production is not that of 47m and, in a salary capped league, that creates  a structural deficiency. Again, nothing against russ the player or guy but everything against russ the contract.

Shipping out Nunn, Beverly, and Russ in 2 separate deals each with 1 FRP is enough 1) moveable salary and 2) assets (note, the lakers picks are highly coveted) where you can totally restructure this roster with better fitting pieces alongside lebron and AD. If you have concerns about playmaking, imo Dennis, Lonnie, Austin, Lebron is enough, not to mention AD being able to create in space. If you don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs enough then fine bring back a playmaker in either of the deals.

Alternatively, if you do not want to do the above, then just punt and say you‚Äôre punting and quit the charade. The worst thing you can do is then move 1 pick for a marginal upgrade - at that point just hold onto all the assets and cash it in alongside the 2023 pick this summer. This path comes with the risk of angering lebron and ad and that piece does not get as much attention as it should imo. 

Regardless, no ‚Äúfringe‚Äù moves, please.",1.0

If cost is a factor which it is, we could always throw in JTA. 

Lakers get their wing, and 2 relatively good shooters and shot creators.

The question is would the lakers be willing to take back salary beyond this season as most of our assets included are expiring salaries and secondly would the knicks do this for multiple seconds or a heavily protected first?

This could be the perfect trade scenario pre-trade deadline where the front office gets to see whether it‚Äôs worth moving off of Westbrook or keeping him if things continue to build well from this move",1.0

23,2022-12-07 17:26:04,zf7brf,Legitimacy of 2020 Championship Can Not Be Challenged,MrBones2k,"I was just watching ""Legacy: The True Story of the LA Lakers"" on Hulu, and the final episode covers the 2020 Championship that took place in ""The Bubble"" in Orlando.

It really struck me how DIFFICULT this Championship was to bring home, and further solidified in my mind the ""legitimacy"" of this title, and I wanted to put down some thoughts.

Main reasons:

1. Kobe died tragically during the season (RIP Mamba).  He was a player and person that likely every single member of the team (and organization) respected and/or idolized.  This was a devastating loss to the Lakers players, org, fans, and more, and not something that one could simply put aside from an emotional perspective. Yet the Lakers kept their focus.
2. All players, on all teams, were dealing with what was a once-in-a-lifetime pandemic (hopefully).  They, their family, friends, and everyone they knew and didn't know*,* worldwide, were all at risk of an unknown virus, that was killing thousands of people a day worldwide.  And they were away from their families during this time. Yet the Lakers kept their focus.
3. George Floyd was murdered.  Followed by the police shooting of Jacob Blake.  Followed by mass protests across the USA, and in many places overseas.  The majority of the Lakers at the time were Black men, so these events undoubtedly hit them (and their loved ones and communities) very hard.  Yet the Lakers kept their focus.
4. The players were separated from their family and friends, and their homes, for over 90 days.  Yet the Lakers kept their focus.

AND, lest anyone tries to cheapen this Championship: all teams had an opportunity to play and win in under similar circumstances.  Yet only the Lakers kept their focus enough to win the Championship.

Anyone that tries to argue that this Championship is somehow ""lesser"" is obviously speaking from a place of jealousy or envy, because their team failed, where the Lakers (again) succeeded.",1.0
