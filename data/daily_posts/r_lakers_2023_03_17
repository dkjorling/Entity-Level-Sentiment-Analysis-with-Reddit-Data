AD have to oractice his free throws every fuckin time if he costs 3 games already from his dumbass mistake. And he still didnt improve.

9,2023-03-18 06:00:14,11ufzfb,Chat GPT has some thoughts‚Ä¶,davidblenkle,"

I asked Chat GPT to write a poem about the challenges of being a lakers fan:

As a Lakers fan, I've seen the highs,
The championships, the glorious prize,
But with the triumphs come the lows,
The struggles, the setbacks, the crushing blows.

We've had our share of superstar names,
Kobe, Magic, Shaq, and James,
But even legends can't guarantee,
A victory, a title, a dynasty.

We've faced injuries, trades, and drama,
Lost games, missed shots, and even karma,
But still we cheer, we never waver,
Our loyalty to the purple and gold, we savor.

We know that being a Lakers fan,
Is not an easy path to take a stand,
But through it all, we stand proud and true,
United in our love for the team, our crew.

So bring on the challenges, the ups and downs,
We'll weather the storms, and wear the crowns,

For being a Lakers fan is not just a choice,
It's a badge of honor, a voice.",1.0
10,2023-03-18 05:57:50,11ufy50,Do you honestly believe this team can win a championship?,Gristle__McThornbody,Championship contenders are not teams that struggle to reach a 500 winning record. Phil Jackson said true contenders reach 40 wins before 20 losses. Good teams find ways to pull off wins down the stretch. This team gets so hyped up after a regular season but realistically it's looking like we are a borderline playoff/play in team that its fate will be determined in the last couple regular season games. What exactly is it that you want to get out of the playoffs if we make it? A championship is out of the question. So what is there to accomplish?,1.0

97,2023-03-17 08:59:30,11tlmi6,We should not focus on the 6th seed.,Mizaistorm,"It would be great if we get the 6th seed and finish the season on a roll but you have to look at who we would end up facing.
Either clippers or golden state or suns.
Our main concern should be the team overall health. Unfortunately we caught injury bug for the last couple of years.
As long as we stay in 7th or 8th seed spot. We should be in good position to make the playoff, then we have to roll the dice with Denver or sac Kings. Both are great teams but as long as we are healthy and winning, I 'll take our chances up against anybody",1.0
