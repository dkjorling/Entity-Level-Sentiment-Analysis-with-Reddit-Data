17,2022-12-08 17:25:26,zg5c0p,I don't understand why people don't want to trade russ anymore after becoming a good bench player on 47 mill,utrid_son_of_utrif,"Don't get me wrong, he's been playing way better and probably the best he's ever done in a lakers uniform but bar wasn't that high to begin with. He's bringing that energy and pace from the bench and his playmaking has been great but it's just negated by his poor shooting, costly turnovers, and horrible shootijg fouls. He's shooting 40.6 % FG 30% 3PT and 69.1% FT on 3.6 TOV.

I know stats aren't everything and I can see what he's bringing off the bench but we clearly are lacking in the wing and big department. We cant risk our bigs getting injured like the cavs game and running a 4 guard lineup is basically just accepting a loss that game. We could trade nunn and beverly and get back around 22 mill but i don't think it'll be enough to make any significant/respectable change to that lineup.",1.0
