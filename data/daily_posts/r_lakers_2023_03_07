So that means in the last 10 LA gained at least a game on everybody outside the top 4 in the west and at least 3!! games on everybody except the warriors &amp; wolves and officially moved into a play in spot. With the way teams are playing, injuries, tanking, strengths of schedule left I think another 7-3 stretch could get the Lakers out of the play in and into the top 6... let's go Lakers!",1.0

Lakers take on the Memphis Grizzlies at home with a chance to move into the play in spots outright. D'Lo is questionable so he might go but Grizzlies without Ja and unfortunately Brandon Clarke, coupled with this being Pau's jersey retirement game it is a must win.

On the rooting guide last night it was another 1-1 night with the Blazers predictably beating the pistons and the Kings doing us another favour and beating the Pelicans, also the Celtics lost again.

&amp;#x200B;

The standings right now looks crazy with Jazz, Blazers, Lakers and Pelicans all sitting with identical 31-34 records. That all can change after tonight's games and if all goes our way we can be up to the 9th seed by the end of the day. 

So here is who we should be rooting for today.

**Rooting Guide.**

1. **76ers(+2.5)** over the Timberwolves
2. **Warriors(-4..5)** over the Thunder
3. **Mavericks(-8.5)** over the Jazz

We have alot of winnable games coming up and need to start building momentum and stacking wins ourselves. We control our destiny.
