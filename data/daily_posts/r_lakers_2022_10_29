4,2022-10-30 03:13:17,yh34qy,Starting Lineups Moving Forward,kwesi777,"While our offense is clearly ass, our defense is holding up as a Top 3 defense league wide. And that‚Äôs technically without AD in the lineup for Game 5. 

Some of this could arguably just be rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic, but what do y‚Äôall think of the following starting lineups: 

Starters: Bev, Troy Brown, LeBron, AD, Wenyen 

Bench: Russ, Nunn, Reaves, JTA, Damian Jones 

Rationale: Wenyen actually is not total hot garbage as a big and really did a good job fighting Minnesota‚Äôs bigs in terms of defending lob threats and dump off passes. Troy Brown‚Äôs shot isn‚Äôt totally broken, and Bev is primarily there to harass the other team at the point of attack. 

The Russ bench youth movement looked promising against the Wolves, letting him just run and gun and create offense for cutters like Reaves and JTA looked not terrible. It‚Äôs a shame Thomas Bryant doesn‚Äôt seem like he will be the stretch big option we hoped for, since he would naturally play well with Russ in terms of providing him more space to operate.

Looking at the Nets and their record is quietly about to be almost as bad as the Lakers at 1-5. It‚Äôs clear that there are issues with that team as well.

I wonder if Pelinka saw what happened with the Sixers waiting and getting Harden and decided that they could do this with Kyrie. Maybe the FO and LeBron were expecting the Nets to be this bad.

That would explain why LeBron signed an extension despite the terrible roster. I don‚Äôt think they expected the Lakers to also be this terrible though so now I feel like they‚Äôre stuck playing a game of chicken.",0.42

You want someone who is durable? Fine, trade for Zubac, he has missed 6 games in like 5 years. Most all star level big men in the NBA are injury prone (except that guy Jokic). They are still invaluable. Hell, most of the stars in the NBA have been fairly injury prone when you stop and pay attention. Elite two way players are a rare breed. The league is filled with one way offensive and defensive stars but few two way stars.  AD will still get you 25/10 a night with elite defense. His 3 point shot at face value is cheeks but once you dig further you realize he only averages 2 attempts a game anyway. If he were averaging 5+ then his 3 point percent would be a bigger issue. He makes up for that with elite paint / restricted area production. He is still a top 15-20 player. What could the Lakers possibly get in return for him that would be worth giving up on him? You're not going to get a better player than him and the draft lottery is as much a gamble as betting on AD's health.",0.55

But the incompetence from FO and ownership could effect their pull on FA/trading in the future, which would be detrimental to the Lakers process in building future teams.**

You have Lebron fucking James on your squad. Arguable face of the league and greatest player to ever grace the sport. He is in the dwindling years along with AD. The team is the Los Angeles Lakers, 17 time champions. Just off of that alone you should go all in to try to do whatever you can to be good. This shit is unacceptable given the Lakers history.

But aside from that consider this: the team doesn‚Äôt really build from the draft, rather constructing their squads through trade/FA. For any willing stars that want out, LA is usually a top destination. What difference will two picks be if they can acquire another star in the future to keep the team competitive?

The issue with that thinking is assuming anyone would want to go to LA now. Every day the Lakers look more incompetent, which doesn‚Äôt exactly give any confidence to upcoming free agents to join your team. You can only pitch good weather and brand opportunities to prospects for so long‚Ä¶ especially when there‚Äôs another team who can do that (with a better FO and ownership as well).

In the era of player empowerment, they notice who is well run and who is not. It‚Äôs why the Knicks have suffered for so long. And if the Lakers keep it up, they‚Äôll suffer too.

Will say the Indiana or San Antonio trade make them contenders? No. But it will make them a playoff team, and more importantly it will IMPROVE the squad. Which as a star player (like Lebron) is all you can ask from your FO, improving the team while you‚Äôre there.

49,2022-10-29 15:51:13,ygn2yn,5 games in and we already know what we are.,poptony3,"These 5 games along with the pre-season already show what this team is and will be if no changes are made. 

1. This roster is poorly constructed, there‚Äôs no way around it. Everybody and their mother knows that the formula for a good Lebron team is Lebron + shooters.
Knowing that Rob opted for our FAs instead of Brynn Forbes, OPJ, Bruce Brown etc. Now we are shooting 25% on 3PTS, and I don‚Äôt see no one on our rooster making it better. 

2. Russ is a bad fit, we all know that, there‚Äôs no way around it he‚Äôs just a bad fit. Dude needs the ball too much, is a poor shooter, bad decision maker, has prob the worst hands for a point guard (thank you skip), bad defender, bad free throw shooter. I can go on and on.

3. Our offense has no identity, there‚Äôs no flow, we are too reliant on Lebron, and AD is not as involved specially in the 4th as he should be. We have no consistent shoot creators or shoot makers, to make the offense work.

4. Bev and Lonnie are better coming off the bench. Actually if we had serviceable starters, we would have a strong bench with them 2 coming off the bench, instead of playing &gt; 30 mins per game.

5. Brown Jr and Reaves are playing good. I‚Äôve been impressed with Brown Jr defense, and how he fits with the started. Nonetheless, they are not starting caliber players, at least at this moment, but can be 3&amp;D guys for us. 

6. Ham has not impressed me with the offense but our defense has been great. We have been in games despite our shooting and all the things mentioned above. It‚Äôs exciting because we can actually build on our defense as the season goes on. 

7. This team won‚Äôt make the playoffs as constructed. The Indiana trade can put us really close to actual contention. Myles at the 5 and AD at the 4 can make up for Buddy being a turnstile, and the offense would improve greatly. However, that deals leaves us with no assets and we would still have a hole in the 3&amp;D department as we only have Troy Brown JR and he‚Äôs not a consistent shooter. The San Antonio deal gives us more flexibility but since we can even move Poelt for a good return, but I highly doubt that Pop will do business with us.

8. The bottom line is that we can all speculate, hypothesize and fantasize about deals but at the end is our FO who has to make a decision and I really have 0 trust in them. We all should just try to see the positives and see how a year of Lebron and AD gets thrown away by probably the worst FO in sports. Trust me this travesty will be taught at GM and FO clases in the future.

Edit: 

Our center rotation is trash. If Jones was impressing like the reports said during training camp, Bryant needs to stay home. This is bad!",0.76
