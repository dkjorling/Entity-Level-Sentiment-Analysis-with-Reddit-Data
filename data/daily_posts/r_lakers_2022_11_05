3,2022-11-06 01:21:27,ynctlb,"Went to last night's Jazz vs Lakers game, here are my observations and insights",Inevitable_Night_933,"- 5 Lakers warmed up pre-game when fans were allowed in. JTA, Austin, Beverly, Brown, and Wenyen. By comparison, I think I saw 8-9 Jazz players shooting the ball pregame including every single starter on the team.

- A few Jazz players were sucking up to the refs pregame, particularly Mike Conley. Did not seem to help much they called a fair game.

-  Darvin has a great energy to him. Every time a Jazz player hit a 3 he had a huge reaction of disappointment, almost like a fan, was endearing to see.

- There is something going on with this team chemistry wise, and not in a good way. When the team was down 14, Russell was laughing and joking with Dennis the entire time meanwhile LeBron looked pissed. I think Russ is just happy to get his stats and knows he's getting traded soon. 

- Russ was in a fantastic mood all night but did not acknowledge the crowd whatsoever despite lots of cheering for him in between moments. It was an odd contrast given the score of the game. 

- Russ talked with AD a bunch and Bev at times, but I did not see Russ and LeBron acknowledge once at all on the bench or anytime the game was not going on. Was very odd. The body language from the team seemed off the entire night too, even when the game got closer.

- Bev was not his usual self and looked hesitant at shooting the 3. He looked awful at shootaround and was not even making easy mid-range jumpers, I think he made one three when I was watching out of 7-8. Austin Reaves and Wenyen by comparison hit 3's consistently at shootaround.

- The coaching staff was mostly critical of people's defensive efforts getting on Russ and Walker the most from what I saw on fouls or timeouts. Darvin many times wanted the pace to be faster than what they were doing on defensive rebounds.

any other questions let me know! I was most surprised by the Bron/Russ dynamic which you didn't necessarily get just watching it on TV",1.0

This is now 4 consecutive games where he‚Äôs been not just good but exceptional off the bench, and even though it‚Äôs a small sample size, keep in mind that it is 100% of his bench games so far. It‚Äôs not like we‚Äôre cherrypicking 4 out of 30 games off the bench, we are simply seeing the result of a new role. 

I get it, 47 million and all that, so say we trade him, then what. Are we not going to acknowledge that he is filling a role I don‚Äôt see anyone else possibly filling? We‚Äôve been talking ad nauseam about getting LeBron another playmaker so he doesn‚Äôt have to carry as big a load on offence allowing him to lock in more on D, and Russ is doing that better than anyone we could possibly trade for. Every single person we are considering trading for is either a play finisher, or can only create offence for them self, meanwhile Russ can do both while also creating for everyone else. 

He‚Äôs also a defensive cheat code if he keeps up the way he‚Äôs been playing on that end. 6‚Äô3‚Äù but VERY strong and VERY quick, allowing him to guard point guards while also being able to survive a mismatch until another switch can be found.

Not to mention he is known to be an iron man, and will likely play 75+ games, which is huge on a team with such rough depth.",1.0

He probably needs to watch some of his last season's shooting highlights to see the difference from this season.",0.63

22,2022-11-05 18:30:53,yn25z2,Best Trade Options for Bev + Nunn,davepoolX,"Well, it seems that we aren't trading Russ anytime soon. I don't think we need to.

We've got enough guard depth (Walker, Russ, Reaves, Schroder with Christie for garbage)

We've got enough SF depth (Brown, JTA, Ryan)

We have almost no PF depth (LBJ, Gabriel)

and almost no C depth (AD, Gabriel at times)

The following are just not that important for us considering our gaping holes at PF/C:

Bev - defensively elite but we'd be a better overall team if we had a PF or C here.

Nunn - decent, slumping but we've got 4 other guards better than him right now, 5 including Bev

Jones - just not that good

Bryant - i'd keep him just cuz he's cheap and has some upside.

So what's the best return we could get for Bev/Nunn + draft assets that provides a better big wing or a center. We REALLY need something better than just Gabriel effectively backing up both positions.",1.0

29,2022-11-05 16:32:23,ymywoj,Is Lebron declining?,panashechd,"No, he isn‚Äôt. After watching LBJ for the past 4-5 years, it‚Äôs clear that Lebron has been passive these last few games. I don‚Äôt know whether he‚Äôs injured or sick but sometimes it looks like he isn‚Äôt all there. He was matched on Lauri several times and didn‚Äôt drive once, that was a huge red flag to me especially since Lauri isn‚Äôt a good defender.

I think people are jumping to conclusions, I remember when we had these same ‚ÄúFather Time‚Äù conversations during the end of the 21‚Äô season. 22‚Äô season he averaged 30 and we were back on the ‚ÄúLebron is perfectly fine‚Äù train. Few months later, he‚Äôs dealing with a sickness and injuries and now he‚Äôs declined again. I‚Äôd expect this from other fanbase but it‚Äôs disappointing from Laker nation. 

I‚Äôm curious to see how the perception on Lebron and Russ will change in the upcoming weeks. Realistically, Russ won‚Äôt average amazing numbers on good efficiency forever, that‚Äôs never been Westbrook. NBA players have great stretches all the time, the same way NBA players have slumps all the time.  

Maybe I‚Äôm wrong, but Russ‚Äô career shows that he goes on these runs occasionally but eventually it wears off. The same way LBJ‚Äôs career shows that he starts each season pretty rough but usually goes back to normal come January, around all star break. So yeah I‚Äôm curious to see how the narrative will switch when we hit that mark in the season.",1.0

31,2022-11-05 15:45:39,ymxmyv,[OC] We might be witnessing the start of LeDecline,regnard,"10% of the season is already done and I was looking for early trends with the Lakers. One thing has been mentioned was the poor play of LeBron (due to health reasons) and a few metrics jumped right out at me.

This season is LeBron‚Äôs slowest start since his rookie year as [per advanced metrics](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/jamesle01.html):

- PER
- True Shooting %
- Box Plus-Minus (BPM)

A quick primer on these metrics: PER looks at over all play and efficiency, BPM looks at impact in the game, TS is a broad shooting metric.

What the these numbers suggest is that LeBron is struggling offensively and has not contributed much positively when he‚Äôs on the floor. His abysmal shooting has sunk his efficiency metrics.

Watching the Lakers games confirms the eye test for LeBron‚Äôs struggles:

- His 3 point shooting has been far laser-like (lowest 3pt% in career)
- Multiple missed layups (3rd lowest fg% of shots near the basket)
- Let‚Äôs not get into defense that much but LeBron is matching his career-high foul rate.

So what does this mean to the Lakers?

LeBron is solid but is far from Legendary All-NBA form with this slow start. That could contribute to more losses than wins. The team could be 5-11 just after Thanksgiving.

I‚Äôm curious to see what the next 8 games will be like and see if this trend continues.",1.0

No one maligned him unfairly by saying that. I do have to say that he's been absolutely great since moving to the bench. It's unfortunate that somehow LeBron forgot how to play basketball during this stretch but it gives me hope that when Bron recovers his form, along with Benchbrook, and ADPOY, this team will present a lot of issues in the NBA. Lonnie and Troy look really solid too. I love the contrasting style of play between Bron and Russ, makes them much harder to plan against. I choose to see the glass, as half full. Have a bit of faith,  we will turn this around.",1.0
33,2022-11-05 15:18:40,ymwwm7,How will our guard rotation look like when Dennis returns?,KralFatih,"Westbrook is playing really good since coming off the bench and it feels like Nunn has fell out of the rotation. Lonnie Walker also performs better than I would have expected , Pat Bev is Pat Bev (even if his stats are worse) and Reaves is Reaves. I dont think we will take minutes away from WB , so whats gonna happen? 

I hope Dennis will perform good aswell, so maybe LeBron doesnt have to look to score as much as he is doing rightnow. He can then find his rhythm again to shoot better and i wouldnt mind him going to a 20/22 ppg and 10apg guy with AD being the first option on offense.",1.0
