0,2022-11-27 07:46:58,z5v4si,Lakers next 10 games are going to be brutal,Xeris,"In their next 10 they're playing: Bucks,  Cavs, Raptors, 76ers, Boston, Denver. Portland and the Wizards are also no slouches. I think it's great that the Lakers have been beating up on the horrible teams they've been playing, I think the next 10 games are going to tell us a lot about how good (or bad) this team actually is. This also features 6 straight road games (6 games in 9 days on the road). A very rough stretch. 

&amp;#x200B;

Hoping for AD and LeBron to stay healthy through the trip and for the Lakers to keep .500 at least.",0.93
