Kawhi then won a ring, the lakers then got lebron and used the Lonzo/Ingram package (which pop tampered with publicly crying to the media and pels front office to not take the deal) to build a contender and win a ring. 

Now pop is ending his career with a whimper in the play ins as Ingram kicks his ass.",0.85

Technically, these teams can execute trades with each other right now.

But do you guys see a scenario where AD/Bron meet with Beal or Lavine to recruit to come to LA? The money would work by doing a sign and trade with Westbrook and using a draft pick or 2, maybe THT as well so that the wizards/bulls at least get something in return instead of just letting them walk.

Just some extreme optimism haha",0.55
