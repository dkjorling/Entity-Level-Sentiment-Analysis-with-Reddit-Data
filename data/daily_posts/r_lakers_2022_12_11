This is madness. Unless we play PERFECT every game, one slip up from a guy like Lonnie or Russ, or foul trouble from AD or LeBron getting slightly injured and we have no backup. It is a felony and criminal what Pelinka is doing right now to this team.",1.0

He‚Äôs decent and would be a great spark with Westbrook off the bench, but his usage rate should not be this high.

From counting stats he seems pretty amazing at 16ppg on 48-39-87 splits. I don't watch the games so maybe it's something stats don't show but he seems like he could probably be fringe all star level talent on a team without AD and Bron.,1.0

Lebron is refusing to cede the keys, even when it‚Äôs clear he‚Äôs not even close to being the best player on this team.

Lebron‚Äôs averaging 21.6 shots a game this season, 7.3 of which are from three when he‚Äôs only shooting .318 from downtown, which is his fourth lowest shooting percentage from 3 in his entire career. This season is the second highest amount of shots he‚Äôs averaged in 15 seasons. (He averaged 21.8 shots last year.) He‚Äôs only ever averaged more shots in 2007-2008 (21.9) and 2005-2006 (23.1). (For perspective, Kobe Bryant, who is  (wrongly) stigmatized as a ball hog chucker, only averaged more shots than Lebron is this season 5 times in his 20 year career.)

By comparison, AD is only averaging 17.3 shots per game. He averaged more shots last season (17.4) and his first year with the lakers (17.7). Coincidentally, the year in which AD averaged the most shots since he‚Äôs been on the Lakers was the year we won the title. When he was with the pelicans, he averaged more than 17.3 shots per game in all but his first two seasons. AD is the number one on this team. Lebron is the 2.

Under no circumstances should Lebron be averaging 4.3 more shots per game than AD, especially when AD is shooting 59% and Lebron is shooting 46%. Those 4.3 shots being given to AD instead of Lebron can easily translate to 8-10 more points per game, especially since AD shoots better at 2s, 3s, and free throws than Lebron.

Lebron is doing a lot of shit this season (except playing defense). Deferring to AD is not one of them. AD does not initiate the offense and is not a ball handler. He has to rely on Lebron, Russ, and the others to get him the ball. The Lakers around AD need to get him the ball the way the NOP got AD the ball. Even when AD played alongside boogie, he got more shots than he gets now. Instead, Lebron is ball hogging the shit and costing us games. See last game. He and Russ completely froze AD out for hero ball when AD was the one who brought us back in the game.",1.0

One of biggest issue with trading Russ is losing that playmaking ability due to his ability to get to the rim((very athletic). With Schroder and Bev being awful playmakers, plus Nunn being a complete flop‚Äî if Russ is traded, is Eric viable candidate to set up AD for 12-14  minutes or was he just complete shit last season??
