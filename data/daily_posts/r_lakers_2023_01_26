22,2023-01-26 22:24:19,10m4f2z,Who is out of rotation?,Bigpoppalos,"Hey guys, I am super excited for the rest of the season, we have been playing well without ad, lonnie and reaves, now all of a sudden we get them back plus rui. Question now is, who is out of rotations because IMO we are a deep team and someone is going to be upset. This is not about who starts, who finishes or actual rotations, just who isnt going to play. 

Roster, not including jones, cole and pippen and in no particular order:

Guards: bev, max, reaves, schoder, loni, west

Wings: troy, rui, bron, jta

Bigs: TB, AD, wenyen

Thats 13 deep, right off the bat we see that wenyen and JTA will not play, leaves us 11. I see it better to have a 9 man rotation leaving 2 more players out.

Easiest part are the bigs AD and Tb will play. Tb defense isnt great but hes been scoring, shooting 3 and bringing energy for us. Occasionally rui will play small ball here as well.

The wings of course lebron, brown has been shooting well and playing good defense so him and the aforementioned rui. Max and reaves can also play here.

Guards is where it gets tough. Someone one will get pissed. I go defense first ( I see it as who can defend the warriors, curry and klay) so has to be bev and shroder. Then reaves and max because they can also play wings and are young. Max has been impressive, hes good defensively and can shoot the 3, because of him the ones left out will be mad. 

So is it westbrook and lonnie that should sit? (Max because hes a rookie or maybe TB because hes a big?) Thats my conclusion but its tough because both bring a lot offensively. Specially westbrook, he gets a lot of easy buckets for our bigs and bron, and of course lonnie was our big signing and most athletic but I just dont see Max get benched at this point right? IMO westbrook has been playing great but I just dont like him in the final minutes of games or defensively. Its going to be interesting to watch what Ham does. Thoughts?",1.0

Moving forward we now have the size of AD and Rui which is already a massive difference. Also sounds like Lonnie is a game or 2 away from his return and Reaves being reevaluated soon. Then we also have Wenyan who‚Äôs hardest worker on our squad.

Bron, AD, Bryant, Schroder, Rui, Bev, Lonnie, Reaves, and Brown should already be your top 9 in minutes played. I would rather have Wenyen for front-court minutes than Russ as the 10th man.

It also makes more sense for Schroder, LeBron, Lonnie, Reaves, AD, and Rui to be getting touches before Westbrook at this point, who was a team worst -10 last night when everyone but Beverley was positive.",1.0

37,2023-01-26 17:06:58,10lwscm,Why can't we trade for Buddy and McConnell and not trade for M. Turner,MrPino777,"I think we have a great off brand Turner in T. Bryant, plus he's going to come at half the cost this off-season (if we bring him back). Also worried Turner would/could leave us for nothing

WB and Lonnie (maybe a protected 1st) for Buddy and McConnell

Buddy helps tremendously on the perimeter plus occasionally he can create for himself and others. Would be better than Lonnie.

McConnell doesn't completely replace WB assists but it's not bad. Plus there won't be as many wild turnovers.

Gives us a trade exception too if I'm not mistaken. Could be worth 20+ mil. 

After watching yesterday's game all it took was those three 3s in a row and it made a huge difference for us.

Indiana's motivation could be us clearing up 27 mil for them this offseason and picking up Lonnie. (Possibly throw in a pick swap or a protected pick)",1.0
