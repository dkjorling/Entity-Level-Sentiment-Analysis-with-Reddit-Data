1,2023-03-16 05:39:17,11sldma,Just look at the bright side,Inevitable-Youth-817,"Yes, we lost to the worst team in the league but that's in the past. All we can do is focus on our next games and I expect the lakers to come out hungry against that Mavs team back home in LA. 

&amp;#x200B;

We're 1 game away from the 7th seed, and 2 from the 6th seed. The Warriors also play TWolves and Mavs once,(Win, Win) while we also play the Mavs and Twolves once. Season is far from over and I expect us to bounce back from this loss.

&amp;#x200B;

The Wolves have a pretty nasty schedule too, ngl, don't think they'll hold that 7th seed for long. Assuming we beat the Mavs Friday (game of the year) I don't think they'll keep up with us after that.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point since they beat the warriors, I'm fine for rooting the clippers to win against other west teams ahead of us (hopefully they'll take care of the thunder and pels since they play them twice each). Let them take the 5 seed and play the suns. Who cares we only want 6-8.

&amp;#x200B;

I honestly think worst- ""realistic"" case scenario is we get the 7th seed and we play the Mavs/Twolves in the play-in  with hopefully a healthy LBJ and AD and smack them to play the grizz in the first round (I doubt they'll even have Adams back by then his knees are dust).",1.0

- Then with 9:50 left in the 4th he takes the most ill advised shot I’ve ever seen in my entire time which leads to another runout three from Jabari making it a 10 point game in less than 1 minute because of a single player

11,2023-03-16 02:58:32,11si7nu,Our drop coverage is so weird and it's so ass,alozz,"I first noticed the weirdness of our defensive scheme when AD kept getting defensive 3 second calls, like 2 times a game at least, especially in pick&amp;roll scenarios and right after. 

The Lakers set their center so far away from the screen setter, like no matter who the ball handler is. 

Drop coverage is NOTHING NEW. It can work well against players who are not good shooters. But the Lakers over-do this to a tragic extend. Even the players who aren't shooters can easily pick up steam, cut-off angles and score against one of the best shot blockers in the NBA, because they have SO MUCH space to work with.

Our big (usually AD), doesn't even pretend to bother ball handlers until they are all the way to the rim. I am not blaming AD, this is a clear coaching decision.  

This was why Ja Morant had like a 30 point quarter a few games ago and even RJ Barrett cooked the Lakers defense. 

Also, the ballside defender on the wing sets himself as a secondary defender, which is also weird for the defender covering the first passing option. This allows the opponents to blow by defenders easily with one or two passes and Lakers always being in chase mode. 

The chase mode also affects our rebounding, messing up matchups and Lakers defense losing players crashing the board. 

Today's Rockets game wasn't anything new, Rockets frontcourt is not especially gifted ball handlers or smartest basketball players. But they are athletic and our drop coverage is so shitty, they were able to blow by constantly and get lay-ups and dunks. 

To the people blaming only the front office for today's loss, while yes, we needed another big, it doesn't excuse Ham's assness as a coach. We have the same problems we've had today when AD is playing, but it is just so much more obvious when he is not. 

I actually really like the squad we have right now, but I don't see us having any kind of success in the playoffs even if we make it with Ham. We have so many problems just with basic man-to-man and I didn't even cover our absolute joke of a zone and our offensive scheme (waste time &amp; play one on one).

I know analysis isn't really that common in the sub and most people won't read it but I wanted to get thoughts of a few people who did and basically release a bit of my anger.",1.0

Nevertheless, it’s the worst team in the nba and we shouldn’t have needed AD to play like I’m seeing on this sub people complaining about. This team is good enough to compete with anybody and if we had a half decent big it would have been a lot better.

If the doctors thought it wasn't worth risking AD in back to backs, you don't risk it. Simple.

The blame lies with the front office who knew about this situation since weeks and also about Mo Bamba being out for a month. So not signing a big, at least on a 10-day contract was incredibly moronic. The big doesn't have to be a good defender. Just any sort of size as a deterrent and a rebounder would have ensured Lakers won the game.

Lakers next 5 games: @HOU, vs DAL, vs ORL, vs PHX, vs OKC

If the Lakers win tonight, they can aim to go 4-1 in this stretch and surpass and gain distance on OKC and Dallas by March 24th. 

 Thunder next 5 games: @TOR, vs PHX, @LAC,  @LAC, @LAL

Thunder aren’t winning more than 3 of these games. 

Mavericks next 4 games: @SAS, @ LAL, @MEM, vs GSW

Mavericks will probably go 2-2. 

PHASE 2: TIMBERWOLVES 

Schedule from March 20th-31st: 

@NYK, vs ATL, @GSW, @SAC, @PHX, vs LAL, 

Lakers should catch the Timberwolves by the end of this stretch. I see the Wolves going 3-3 over this stretch and if the Lakers can beat Phoenix, they very well may run the table. Te head to head vs the Wolves is crucial in this stretch too. The Lakers schedule over this stretch is

vs PHX, vs OKC, vs CHI, @CHI, @MIN

PHASE 3: CLIPPERS &amp; WARRIORS 

If the Lakers go 7-3 or better in their next 10,  this is the phase in which the Lakers can declare “we aren’t settling for the play in tournament”…though; it will probably be the toughest test of the playoff push. 

Clippers: @NOP, vs LAL, vs POR, @PHX 

If the Lakers can beat the Clippers, the Clippers will likely go 2-2 over their final 4 games.

He was always seen as a selfish, no defense-playing kind of player that was inefficient. That’s kind of what the Lakers are not looking for.

Since joining the Lakers, he’s looking like their missing piece. Efficient 3rd scorer that has shed new light on the team and has held it down during LeBron’s absence.
