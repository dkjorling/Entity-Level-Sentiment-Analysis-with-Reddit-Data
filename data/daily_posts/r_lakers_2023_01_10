I still see a lot of doubters and naysayers almost reminding me of the 2020 season lol a healthy Lebron &amp; AD have shown they are arguably the best duo in the league and with a decent supporting cast, they are very good. We have already beaten some very good teams and have been competitive in most games we’ve played halfway through the soon so far. The way we are perceived is fair considering our horrible start to the season but with how much change our team had including new coach, lots of roster turnover and key injuries to Schroeder and TB, it’s understandable we started slow but now we’re picking it up. Once we get AD healthy and Reaves back, we have a good shot at climbing in the standings and being a top 4-5 seed by end of the season. Add to that, a trade for a wing *might* be made in the next month, it’s looking up for us bois. Just gotta hope our big dawgs can stay healthy.",1.0
