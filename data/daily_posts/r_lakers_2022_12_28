https://www.nba.com/stats/lineups/advanced?CF=GROUP_NAME*NE*Davis:GROUP_NAME*E*Bev:GROUP_NAME*E*Schr&amp;TeamID=1610612747&amp;slug=advanced

The answer is obvious that Pat Bev, Schroeder and Walker do not work out. Anthony Davis isn't in the game to save them.

All the lineups are just complete trash, and Ham keeps using them.

Why not switch it up? Here's the lineups without AD that work:
https://www.nba.com/stats/lineups/advanced?CF=GROUP_NAME*NE*Davis&amp;TeamID=1610612747&amp;slug=advanced

The simple fix is to swap Reaves for Pat Bev. Ham is too scared or what?

LeBron Bryant Reaves Westbrook Lonnie - 20.5 net rating
Swap Westbrook with Schroeder - 20.8 net rating

LeBron Wenyen Reaves Walker Westbrook - 16.4

I think we see a pattern here... Anyway the answers are obvious just wanted to give you fans the links to the data.",1.0

Buss trust owns 66% so no they do not get the full sale amount. Mark Walter and Todd Boehly Who bought AEG ownership of the lakers own 27% and has the right to buy the buss trust 66% of the team if they choose to sell. Mark Walter is part of the ownership of the dodgers so I’m sure that ownership group minus Peter Guber since he owns the warriors would be the ones who buy the lakers. 

All this breaks down to me say the buss family is not selling their ownership stake in the lakers. This is the only money the kids get and splitting 66% of a sale among 6 kids doesn’t come close to being worth it for them. We are stuck with the buss kids.",1.0

There’s no reason to just be throwing out favors because now he is upset about being competitive.
