2,2023-03-02 05:47:05,11fuhgt,Current state of Lakers tie-breakers against 5th-13th seeds in the West,BrianC_,"First, for anyone that does not know the tie-breaker rules, taken from [NBA.com](http://global.nba.com/standings/)

&gt;TIEBREAKER BASIS FOR TWO-WAY TIES:

&gt;(-) Tie breaker not needed (better overall winning percentage)

&gt;(1) Head-to-head won-lost percentage

&gt;(2) Division leader wins tie from team not leading a division

&gt;(3) Division won-lost percentage for teams in the same division

&gt;(4) Conference won-lost percentage

&gt;(5) W-L Percentage vs. Playoff teams, own conference

&gt;(6) W-L Percentage vs. Playoff teams, other conference

&gt;(7) Net Points, all games

&amp;nbsp;

###Los Angeles Lakers

**Division Record:** 3-9

**Remaining division games:** 3/5 GSW, 3/22 PHX, 4/5 @LAC, 4/7 PHX

&amp;nbsp;

###Golden State Warriors

**Current head-to-head record against the Lakers:** 1-2, plays @LAL 3/5

**Division Record:** 4-7

**Remaining division games:** 3/2 LAC, 3/5 @LAL, 3/13 PHX, 3/15 @LAC, 4/7 @SAC

In order to own the tie-breaker over the Warriors, the Lakers need to win the final game of their season series.  If they lose, it'll come down to who has a better division record.

&amp;nbsp;

###Los Angeles Clippers

**Current head-to-head record against the Lakers:** 3-0, plays LAL 4/5

With a head-to-head record of 3-0, even if the Lakers win the final game of their season series, the Clippers still own the tie-breaker over the Lakers.

&amp;nbsp;

###Dallas Mavericks

**Current head-to-head record against the Lakers:** 2-1, plays @LAL 3/17

**Division Record: 8-2**

Even though there is still a chance to tie the season series at 2-2, due to the Mavericks having a division record of 8-2, even if the Lakers win their 4 remaining division games to bring their division record to 7 wins, the Mavericks would still own the tie-breaker over the Lakers.

&amp;nbsp;

###Minnesota Timberwolves

**Current head-to-head record against the Lakers:** 1-0, plays @LAL 3/3, LAL 3/31

**Division Record:** 8-7

Due to the Timberwolves having a division record of 8-7, even if the Lakers win their 4 remaining division games to bring their division record to 7 wins, the Timberwolves would still have a better division record.  So, the only way the Lakers can own the tie-breaker is if they win the remaining 2 games against the Timberwolves to earn a head-to-head record advantage.

&amp;nbsp;

###Utah Jazz

**Current head-to-head record against the Lakers:** 2-0, plays LAL 4/4, @LAL 4/9

**Division Record:** 5-6

**Remaining division games:** 3/3 @OKC, 3/5 @OKC, 3/22 POR, 4/6 OKC, 4/8 DEN

In order to own the tie-breaker over the Jazz, the Lakers need to win their remaining 2 games against them to advance the tie-breaker to division record --&gt; conference record --&gt; etc.

&amp;nbsp;

###New Orleans Pelicans

**Current head-to-head record against the Lakers:** 1-2, plays LAL 3/14

**Division Record:** 7-4

In order to own the tie-breaker over the Pelicans, the easiest path for the Lakers would be winning the final season series game.  If they cannot do that, the Lakers would need to win their remaining division games while the Pelicans lose all of theirs just to advance the tie-breaker to conference record --&gt; etc.

&amp;nbsp;

###Portland Trail Blazers

**Current head-to-head record against the Lakers:** 2-2

**Division Record:** 5-8

**Remaining division games:** 3/22 @UTA, 3/26 OKC, 4/2 @MIN

In order to own the tie-breaker over the Trail Blazers, the Lakers would need to finish with a better division record or tie them to progress the tie-breaker to conference record --&gt; etc.

&amp;nbsp;

###Oklahoma City Thunder

**Current head-to-head record against the Lakers:** 1-1, plays @LAL 3/24

In order to own the tie-breaker over the Thunder, the Lakers need to win their remaining game against them.  Whoever wins that game will own the tie-breaker.",1.0

But watching tonight's game was also a reminder of how fun it is to root for a bunch of role players and hustle guys and developing guys who all mesh together.

I hope we run this squad back. I'm so grateful we're past the Westbrook era.

But if we're not a championship team -- and between Bron's age/health and AD's health/beta personality, I don't know that we are -- I'd kinda love for us to move on sooner rather than later.

What I'd want is for us to do what the Brooklyn Nets did a couple of years ago (and are doing right now) and what the Clippers did before Kawhi/PG: build up a squad of high level, overachieving role players who are either still developing or in their prime.

Then overachieve for a year or two, build a culture, and then try to lure another superstar to be the next billboard Lakers player.

I think part of me also wonders what could've been if we had like Vanderbilt, Caruso, Josh Hart, Gary Payton II, &amp; Austin Reaves all on the same squad. Not as the starting five, but as key glue pieces doing all the dirty work so our stars can shine.",1.0

80,2023-03-01 15:22:13,11f6h1m,Taylor Jenkins just outcoached Darvin last night,Nicoreyn,"One of our main issues this season has been a lack of scheme adjustments after halftime, leading to incredible 3rd quarters from the opponent. 

We watched it happen again last night.

Ja started off 3-14 in the first half; we basically funneled him to AD every play and went under screens in the half court.

That 3rd quarter Ja made it a point to avoid going straight at AD (besides that one tough reverse layup) and we had no answer.

https://youtu.be/yAYZVLrbU3E

Watch Ja‚Äôs buckets in that 3rd. He changed his attack: he goes early in transition (before AD gets back on D) leans heavily on that floater, and kills Austin, Dennis, and Troy on his first step around that screen, so he can just elevate.

Ham‚Äôs first response is always to change WHO is guarding a player instead of HOW we should guard them‚Ä¶ and then the actual right person to guard him (Vando) didn‚Äôt get time on him until late in the 4th.

Dennis was the worst on Ja all night; didn‚Äôt fight through screens causing AD to guard 2 people downhill every play (+Xavier Tilllman was killing on the glass)

I actually think Darvin has been great for this team; but this could be detrimental looking forward to the play in. It‚Äôs rookie coach stuff, comes with it unfortunately.

Thoughts? Am I off base here?",0.69
