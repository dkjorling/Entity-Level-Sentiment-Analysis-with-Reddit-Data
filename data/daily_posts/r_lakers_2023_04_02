1,2023-04-03 06:36:39,12abveu,Charles Barkley is tired of talking about the Lakers: 'It's a conspiracy',AkaiShuichi24," Barkley, a member of the [Basketball Hall of Fame](https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nba) and a current analyst for TNT, unloaded on the Lakers during halftime of their game against the Boston Celtics on Tuesday night.  

 ""The Lakers stink,"" Barkley said when asked to recap the first half. ""Y'all forcing us to show them all the time like they're going to be good."" 

Asked who was forcing him to discuss the Lakers, Barkley responded, ""The NBA.""

""It’s a conspiracy,"" he added. ""And then we got all these clowns on television having to talk about them every day"" 

 Los Angeles entered [Tuesday’s game against Boston](https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nba/boston-celtics) with a record of 11-15, 12th in the Western Conference.  

 Barkley wanted to know why the crew on ""Inside the NBA"" was talking about the 12th seed in the West, while the No. 12 seed in the Eastern Conference never gets discussed.  

 ""We don’t ever talk about the Washington Wizards, do we? Ever,"" Barkley said. ""Do we ever mention the Washington Wizards? The great Bradley Beal? No. 

""But, for some reason, these morning talk shows and us, we have to show the Lakers all the time. The Lakers stink."" ",1.0

4,2023-04-03 05:01:28,12aa1nc,Suns Defensive Matchup Brainstorming,Willdebeast25,"Hypothetically, let’s say we finish the season strong and play the suns in the first round as the 5th seed. We beat them last time without KD and Ayton, and obviously Bron is back so the matchups would be different.             

Most likely, Ham would maintain the starting 5 as of late, but there would be mismatches defensively. Vando, who guarded Booker last time, would likely switch to Kd. You would put reaves on booker, and while he’s a decent on ball defender, I feel that booker would have a field day with him from the mid range. LeBron in playoffs is another breed, but idk if he could maintain guarding a shifty guard like him all game.

Now we know Bamba is hurt (should be back for the first round) and wenyen isn’t the best defender, but would it make more sense to play wenyen or Bamba along side AD, so AD could gaurd KD and one of the two could hold ayton and rebound. We’ve also seen AD’s ability to fly around the floor as a 4 and it would less of mismatch physically than vando imo, for at least a portion of the game. 

Now this would slide vando over to booker, and our two best defenders would try their best to lock them down, since the rest of the suns depth is non existent. This lineup would run bron at point, dlo at 2-guard, then vando, AD, and Bamba/wenyen.

Now this may not be our first round matchup, but in case it was I want to know what you think about this hypothetical and if it would defensively match with them better. The lineup we have at the moment is working fantastically, but if size becomes an issue, we might need to play them like Vogel used the 2020 team with tall ball. Ham would probably not approve of this though lmao",1.0

With that being said, 6th seed is absolutely in the horizon. The boys know they control their own destiny and I'm pretty sure we'd get that W you on the Jazz which leaves us our last 2 since we're playing x2 Jazz, Suns and flippers. In which I think we'd go 3/4 but it wouldn't be shocking if we go 4/4 since I think we can.

Picture this realistic scenario
Warriors go 2-2 (42-40 overall): 2 home games 2 road games so plausible. 

Suns continue to dominate and hold on to 4 seed

Clippers split their next 2 (42-39): one game to go. They lose to us so it’s plausible

Lakers go 4-1 (43-39): including a win vs the stupid Clippers. 

NOP - who cares assume they finish not involved

It’s now 1230p PT on April 9th and the Suns vs Clippers tips-off. If Clips win they have to play one of the hottest team in the West (The Suns) in the 4/5 matchup. If Suns win they have to play the other hottest team in the west (Lakers baby!).

They both wanna lose. They both try to rest players because it’s last game of the season. We’re all biting our nails hoping not to play the Suns in round 1.
