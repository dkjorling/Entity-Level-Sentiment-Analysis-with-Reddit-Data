As a long time Laker fan, and youth basketball coach, I find it absurd that people shat on Vogel as a coach, and somehow think Ham is just as good or better. This roster and player availability is MILES better than last year.  AD only played 40 games last year, and LBJ 56. This year AD has already played 29, and LBJ 42. 

I don't want to beat a dead horse, but Ham is a really bad HC. Not just bad. Really bad. Why?

1) He tried to institute a 4 in 1 out offense on a team that doesn't have outside shooting. Never made sense from the start.

2) He is horrible at half-time and in game adjustments. He has slightly improved in this area lately, but he's been extremely bad over the course of the year. You can look to any game where the Lakers were +/- 5 points at the half and what their record is, and compare it to any decent HC. 

3) He has a horrible sense of timeout use and momentum swings. This is one area I expected him to at least be decent at, but it's been remarkably bad. This is one area I THINK he can improve in. 

4) Do I need to even mention the 3/4 guard lineups, let alone the dreaded 5 guard lineup. Sigh.

5) Allowing WB to close close games. I mean just look at the data and make an objective HCing decision here. 

&amp;#x200B;

As a Laker fan, I'm rooting for his success, but I'm just tired of reading this nonsense about Vogel. No coach is perfect. I guarantee none of you could have done a better job. But we lost a legit championship coach that could have guided this time to more championships w/ his defensive mindset. Players played together and played hard under him when he had a reasonable roster. 

**Good news:**

Lakers have one of the softest SOS's going forward. They have nearly everyone healthy, so they should go on a run. They have a good enough roster to win the West (not place first, but make it to the finals). That's assuming AD and LBJ can stay healthy. 

So no apologies... if this roster stays healthy, it's good enough to win. I guarantee you Vogel could win the west with this roster. Let's hope Ham figures some things out and gets these guys to gel.",1.0

Nets odds doubled I think from 7/1 to 14/1 ( can‚Äôt remember exact ). At the time it was an expected 50-60% odds move .

Our odds a week ago were 50/1, they went to 35/1 after these last two wins/Celtics competitive loss. They moved now in last day from 35/1 to 22:1, the last 5/1  bit JUST FROM KYRIE RUMOUR I believe . This isn‚Äôt as big a move as in the summer with kyrie but it‚Äôs still a real move reflecting it not alll being copium . This gives us some odds 

I‚Äôd advise people to not expect it as the lines woukd move more if it was closer to being a thing, but it‚Äôs out there as a thing at least. If we get closer I‚Äôd expect further odds moving. Don‚Äôt expect kyrie , but I seriously don‚Äôt think his trade value is very high ti any other team , dunno why others woukd risk it on him like us ( cos we got Russ to move n Lebron here),  
likely the nets work out a way to stay , as long as Russ is moved eventually it‚Äôs ok for us.  Don‚Äôt get bummed if we don‚Äôt get kyrie , but let‚Äôs hope for the best . Oh also nets odds moved from 10/1 to 14/1 ( maybe was 7-9/1 last couple weeks ir even just before this rumour )",1.0

41.2 FG - lowest since rookie year 
28.1 3 Fg - continues downward trend - atrocious considering wide open looks
66.1 FT - continues downward trend - second lowest of career - 4 out of 5 years under 67 

45.3 - eFG - second LOWEST in NBA 

Defense - bad - net negative 
Turnovers - high - no bueno 

1.) Why the F is he playing 
2.) Why in the 4th quarter 
3.) Why ball handling in 4th


It‚Äôs almost like Jeannie and ham go with what the announcer say on ESPN and TNT things that are good about Russ. They are paid to keep viewers and Russ has a high recognition name. 


I mean, if this was an NFL quarterback, would he be playing? 

High interceptions, 
High turnovers, fumbling all the time, lowest completion percentage in the NFL, other players don‚Äôt want to play w him. 

Would Pop, Spo, Nurse, and coach in the NBA let this happen? 

Ham must have an IQ under üíØ. 

Did A.D. and LeBron push to have him sign? Absolutely but they‚Äôre also smart enough to shift gears",1.0
