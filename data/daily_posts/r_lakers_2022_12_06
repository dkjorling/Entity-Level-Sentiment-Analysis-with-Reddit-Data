15,2022-12-07 02:23:23,zepi42,"Lakers fans, let the Myles Turner thing go.",aaronjaffe,"You donâ€™t want him. AD has been amazing at the 5, and Thomas Bryant is comparable to any backup center in the western conference (with only a $2 million price tag). 

What you need is as close to an Andrew Wiggins comp as you can get. A versatile wing with length who can carry a high workload on defense, and contribute on defense. Preferably with some decent 3 range.

You need that even more than pure shooters. Otherwise too much of the defense load is on Lebron or tall wings like Kuzma get to have a field day shooting over smaller lakers guards.  

Whoâ€™s that guy? Who could they realistically get? Hereâ€™s what I came up with, but Iâ€™m sure thereâ€™s a better answer.â€¦  

Jarred Vanderbilt - Back to the Utah well? Heâ€™s playing really well, shooting 46% from 3 on the year, and only 23yo with a $4.3 mil/year cap hit. 

Kuzma - Ironic that heâ€™s the perfect fit. No time to be proud though. If Wizards nose dive, make the call and try to bring him back. 27 years old with a 13 mil cap hit.  

Patrick Williams - Bulls may decide to blow it up, and they just demoted Williams to the bench. Only 21, which isnâ€™t ideal if you need him to contribute immediately, but heâ€™s 6â€™7, shooting 42% from 3 this year, and only a $7.75 mil cap hit (3 mil less then Nunn).  

Dorian Finney-Smith - Epitome of a 3&amp;d player. 29 years old, only a 12 mil cap hit. Heâ€™s also having a really off year so far. If the Mavs continue to struggle could Lakers land him relatively cheap in a 3 way?

Please donâ€™t trade for 6-6â€™3 shooters. Please donâ€™t trade for someone who will fuck up the spacing for ADâ€¦just have to assume heâ€™ll be healthy or it doesnâ€™t matter who they get. Please donâ€™t trade for some 6â€™7 33 year old forward who canâ€™t be a workhorse on defense and will be washed in 3 years (Bogdanovicâ€¦Iâ€™m looking at you).",1.0

23,2022-12-06 21:31:25,zeipzl,Thoughts on the potential Kuzma reunion rumors?,TorontoRaptors34,"Me personally, I am on the split ends with it. He has grown a little bit and gotten better as a player with a bigger role. Sure he has flaws like everyone taking bad shots and turning the ball over. But he would be a solid forward wing that could give this team size and I think with more support from fans not expecting him to be a star will help him succeed. You could tell he hasnâ€™t gotten over the trade and wants to be a Laker given how much he trolls the organization and LeBron. Hell, even Lonzo wants to come back but thats another conversation. 

I think one thing people forgot is how much hate he received its a love letter compared to the hate Russ has gotten this past yr but he got his fair share of hate. Mofos were trashing him saying he deserves to play in China and that the only reason he on the team is cuz he piping Jeanie. But after last yr I think everyone was so focused on what he wasnâ€™t that they forgot what he could offer and thats the energy and effort on both ends as well as size. If he returns he prob wonâ€™t score as much but he can provide and extra defender in the paint and the perimeter as well as chemistry with the stars. Not to mention him and Ham will get along cuz of there Michigan connections. 

I would however like to mention that Kuz welcomed a change because he wanted to grow as a player and get a bigger role which is kinda what he has in DC. But who knows maybe he realized that it didnâ€™t bring him the joy he thought and he misses the bright lights. I think maybe now that theres less expected of him heâ€™d do better especially next to the best of the best elite playmakers of Russ and Bron. It would be funny to have Russ and Kuz on the same team but who cares. Having Kuz would also take scoring load off of guys like Bron and Russ as well as help AD. Not to mention Kuz and TB reunion too. PJ washington would be a better fit given hes a better shooter I will say that but Kuz is better at everything else and is a respectable shooter too so theres that.

Do I think it will happen ehh no but crazier things have occurred and its clear as day Kuz wants to come back. Lets not kid ourselves. But rumors r jus rumors until a series outlet has said something.",1.0

if you are under that assumption than trading both picks in a final ""get us over the top trade"" is the obvious next move...Lakers currently have no players of value to any team other than expiring contracts to match salary...so the two picks are what will separate them in the trade market from other teams who do actually have decent players who can contribute in a trade...

Myles Turner for Bev/Nunn two 1sts... Vanderbilt, Beasley for two 1sts...
OG Anunoby for two 1sts... etc...

trading the two 1sts assumes that trade will put you in position to win a title this year...and the player(s) you trade for will be the pieces you build with moving forward...Lakers would be in the trade market for younger players and not aging veterans...",1.0

31,2022-12-06 17:42:45,zecx3f,"I told a AI bot to write a story about Barack Obama, but replace his last term with him being the point guard of the LA Lakers",nerdfleks,"Input:
Write a story about Barack Obama but replace his last term in office with being the point guard of LA Lakers

Output:
Barack Obama was never one to shy away from a challenge. So when the opportunity presented itself for him to become the point guard of the LA Lakers, he jumped at the chance.

As the former President of the United States, Obama was no stranger to the spotlight. But stepping onto the court as a professional basketball player was a whole new level of pressure.

At first, Obama struggled to adjust to the faster pace of the game. He was used to making calculated decisions and executing them with precision, but basketball required a different kind of quick thinking and agility.

But Obama was determined to succeed. He spent hours practicing his ball-handling skills and studying game tapes to learn the strategies of his opponents. His hard work paid off, and soon he was dishing out assists and making clutch shots with the best of them.

The Lakers quickly became a force to be reckoned with, thanks in part to Obama's leadership on the court. He inspired his teammates with his tireless work ethic and unshakeable confidence.

In his first season with the Lakers, Obama led the team to the playoffs, where they faced off against the Golden State Warriors in a nail-biting seven-game series. Obama put on an incredible performance, scoring a career-high 40 points in the deciding game to secure the win for the Lakers.

The victory was a historic moment for both 
Obama and the Lakers franchise. It was the first time in over a decade that the team had won a championship, and Obama was hailed as a hero for his role in bringing the title back to LA.

Obama continued to play for the Lakers for the next few seasons, cementing his legacy as one of the greatest point guards in the history of the game. And though he may have left the world of politics behind, his impact on the court was just as great as it was in the White House.",1.0

KD and Dirk (Lebron can body them but theyâ€™re too tall and too good of shooters. They can just shoot over him)

MJ and Kobe (have too many moves to bet on stopping 1 on 1. We never seen MJ/Lebron March up, but we seen Kobe cook Lebron time after time 1 on 1. And MJ and Kobe are basically the same offensively)

TD and Blake are not as skilled offensively as the other 4, but theyâ€™re strong enough to body Lebron for a hook.

Idk what to make of Giannis. Heâ€™s not really that offensively skilled like the others, but heâ€™s fast, long, and strong enough to give Lebron problems. He might get him off the dribble.",1.0
