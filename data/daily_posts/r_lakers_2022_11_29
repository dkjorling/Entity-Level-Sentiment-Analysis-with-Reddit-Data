We gave up Zu for absolutely nothing, they have like 6 different wing guys (Covington, Batum, Morris, Powell, Mann, Coffey) who would start on this team, and they just pulled a reverse us! Down like 16 going into the 4th and managed to beat the Trailblazers.

And they don't even have PG or Kawhi!! All I'm saying is that if we lose to the Trailblazers

14,2022-11-30 02:04:17,z8dti3,Really not understanding the Lebron hate,_BTFan,"Let me start with this: Lebron did not play well last night. But why are we ignoring context? He dropped 10 points in 3 minutes and then rolled his ankle. He was clearly injured ever since. 

Now to those saying he should‚Äôve just sat out - that‚Äôs easy to say after a loss. But have you ever seen an NBA player, let alone one who‚Äôs been competing for over half his life, take himself out of a game unless it was a bad injury? What would you/the media say if he did take himself out? ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs old/washed/soft/unreliable.‚Äù And either way it would be on Darvin Ham to take him out of the game. 

While he didn‚Äôt have a good game, I really don‚Äôt think this team would‚Äôve been in any semblance of a better position with him off the court. Who would‚Äôve taken his minutes, Kendrick Nunn? I‚Äôd still take Lebron even just for his passing and the attention he gets from the defense.

It's a weird tendency that he has this team isn't Milwaukee to where Giannis Middleton and Jrue could take a break and the lead blossoms 6 more points.

He threw Lebron on the bench late in the 3rd vs the Clippers the 2nd game of the season that happened.

AD sat for 8 straight minutes vs the Cavs and the Kings the final 4 minutes of the 3rd and 1st 4 minutes of the 4th.

I‚Äôm a huge Bron stan, but if you watch these games, it‚Äôs obvious. He jacks terrible 3s, runs post isos and shoots awful fadeaways, doesn‚Äôt get back on defense, and commits terrible turnovers.

Is LeBron washed? Hell no. On the contrary, I think he can still get 20-25 points and play at an all star level. But he‚Äôs no longer good enough to be a true #1 guy, and guess what, that‚Äôs okay. He‚Äôs almost 40 years old, it‚Äôs been time for him to take a step back. Idk if its Steph getting his 4th or Kareem‚Äôs record, but this is the most selfish version of LeBron I‚Äôve ever seen. In the 19-20 season, he played PG and made sure AD got the ball. Now its 3 years later and for some reason LeBron seems hellbent on proving that he‚Äôs still ‚Äúthe guy‚Äù.

I‚Äôm not putting any blame on AD for ‚Äúbeing passive‚Äù in the 4th. It‚Äôs on LeBron to be a fucking leader and get him the ball. Austin should be doing more ballhandling with Bron as a screener.

I've got enough. Lebron James just isn‚Äôt a good player anymore.

I mean look at this on off stats: if Lebron is on the court, the Lakers score 107 points per 100 possessions. If he's off the court, they score 112. 

On the other hand, you can clearly see that Lebron is getting old. But he isn‚Äôt just a bit less jumpy, he can‚Äôt even drill threes as he did last season. His efficiency has never been so bad since his rookie season.

That's ridiculous. Everyone's talking about Lebron‚Äôs bad defence (our opponents score 112 points when he‚Äôs on the court and 110 if he isn‚Äôt), but his offence isn‚Äôt better. 

And you can't tell me that's just because he is in the starting line-up, so he just plays the good players of the opposing teams. 

Just look at the offensive rating with Anthony Davis! on court 113 points, off court 103. It‚Äôs the same with Westbrook, on court 114, off court 104.

In other words: Lebron is MINUS 5.5 when he is on the Court and PLUS 7.5 when he is off the court. And this is your franchise player????

And in my opinion, we see that also in games, so it isn‚Äôt just a stat-myth. An example would be our last game against the Pacers. Look at Lebron in the CRUNCHTIME! The Pacers drained three after three and Lebron defended like James Harden in an elimination game. He just went after the Rebounds, like Westbrook. 

I‚Äôll tell you the truth: we aren‚Äôt going to win a championship along as Lebron is our franchise player (and if he is the second man behind AD).",1.0

2. Contest every shot, goes hand in hand with #1

3. Keep moving on offense, stop holding the ball

4. Bigger lineups, not smaller. Need more AD and TB lineups.

5. Minimize Russ and Lebron‚Äôs minutes together",0.86

The concerning part is because of personnel it probably won‚Äôt ever change and the coach stacking extra challenges (Nunn, 4 guard lineups , misuse / neglecting to use Wenyen, TB, Christie ) 

I honestly don‚Äôt know how a group of Pro NBA player find it so hard to just make an extra open look or two every game. They get the open looks, they keep themselves in games but because of how awful the offense is one bad stretch and it gets 10x harder for this team while the other team almost always has reliable shot making and actual team construction 

This team can be good and the mistakes are so fixable which makes losses like last night so much harder to take and when you realize it‚Äôs the same mistakes over and over and over it kinda begs the question of why isn‚Äôt it getting fixed , how don‚Äôt they see it and will it ever be acknowledged and attended to ?",1.0

72,2022-11-29 08:00:10,z7nel1,"There will be more games like the one today, why are we surprised?",clamscasinoooooo,"Because of this guard heavy roster that lacks shooting the Lakers rely heavily on fast break opportunities to score.

That‚Äôs great in the first half. But when adjustments are made at half time such as doubling or tripling LeBron/AD or clogging the paint - this team will struggle. If it‚Äôs a close game in the final minutes like today or against Portland? We will struggle to score and get quality looks.

The reason why is our half court offense is near the bottom of the league because we didn‚Äôt sign or trade for any shooters who teams can‚Äôt cheat off. Bonafide shooters get plays made for them. 

When you have LeBron and AD and no real shooters teams respect, your only game plan in a tight ball game is to rely on LeBron and AD to make something happen even though the defense will solely be focused on them because no one else is a perimeter threat.

Then we have the issue of lack of wing defenders. You know people who can slow down a team from making a comeback when you‚Äôre up 17 late in a game. 

There will be more games this year that will follow this exact timeline:

Lakers look dominant in the first half -&gt; teams make an adjustment at the half -&gt; thus leading to the ‚Äúthird quarter lakers‚Äù -&gt; teams with shooters hit shots -&gt; lakers defense and lack of shooting can‚Äôt keep up in a shootout -&gt; one possession game lakers become reliant on their two stars -&gt; teams focus on them. 

This season was cooked before our first preseason game because the front office doesn‚Äôt want to build a modern NBA roster that requires shooting and wing depth. 

Today this sun is pointing fingers at LeBron, Russ, Ham etc. Next time it happens it‚Äôll be someone else. In the end, it‚Äôs goes back to the front office.",1.0
