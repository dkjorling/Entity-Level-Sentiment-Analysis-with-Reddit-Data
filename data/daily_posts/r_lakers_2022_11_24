1,2022-11-25 04:05:48,z43eeo,Our only current rivals are the Celtics,LALakers4Lyf,"Tldr: This is because we sucked from 2014-2018, so our rivalries with most teams (except those green shits) died. Whatever other ""rivalry"" we have is really a rival of LeBron himself, unsurprising since he made 9 Finals trips in 10 years

We're tied with Boston for 17 championships, with even more additional fuel tossed in there with Cs fans discrediting our 5 Minneapolis Championships while Laker fans retort with the 11 titles won during an era of 8 teams. Even more with LeBron having his own history against Boston since 2008

Apart from that, there's no one else.

Spurs - There's nobody left from the 2000s rivalry + we took a deep dive to the bottom after 2013 while the Spurs remained contenders/playoff teams, effectively ending the rivalry

Warriors - The only one who has a rivalry with GS is LeBron. We sucked during the GS dynasty, they sucked during our championship season, we reversed roles again in 2022, and the 2021 Play In was more LeBron vs Curry

Suns - We live rent free in their heads, and can you blame them? Since the Kobe era, despite beating us in the playoffs 3 times (2006, 2007, 2021), they never won the championship. The two times we beat them (2000, 2010) led to 2 championships, with 2010 being Nash's last playoff run with the Suns. Recently, it's just the LeBron and Laker tax. If anything, they should thank us for getting them the pick that became Mikhail Bridges

Kings - ""The Kings weren't our rivals. They never beat us. The Spurs are our rivals"" - Kobe during the late 2000s

Clippers - They're just trying to reestablish themselves in LA since Sterling was forced out and Balmer bought the team, and what faster way to gain publicity than to pick a fight with the Lakers. In 2020, there was a case to be made because they got the two stars who were linked to us for years (Kawhi and PG), who also happened to view LeBron as a huge rival. Now though? Both teams have been too injured to resume the intensity of the 2020 matchups",1.0

Like the sub tweets and IG sneak disses are too much, considering he was the one who preferred Russell over Buddy Hield. 

Like the greats never age well, even Kobe became a caricature of Mamba Mentality towards the end, but does he honestly think LA should rip up the floor boards for a guy who can no longer single handedly carry a team to the finals? 

Anyone else ready to get back to the Kobe/West/Magic Lakers basketball? Tired of kowtowing to the King?",1.0
