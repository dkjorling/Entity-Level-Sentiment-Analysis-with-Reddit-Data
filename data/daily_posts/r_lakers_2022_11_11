2,2022-11-12 07:31:45,yszsj3,Anyone feel Pat Bev was hired by Danny Ainnge and Bahmer to bomb the Lakers from the inside out üòÇ,TorontoRaptors34,"Something about Pat Bev jus doesn‚Äôt look right with this team. Whats funny is how this dude did what Russ said yrs ago about him. All Pat do is run around and do nothing since being a Laker. My homie told me Pat Bev doesn‚Äôt work if you don‚Äôt have shooting because he‚Äôs not a guy guy he‚Äôs a glue guy who talks to young guys, plays d and maybe hits a few shots. But even then he is expected to do a job. He has been a 38% shooter his whole career and since being a Laker he can‚Äôt hit the side of the barn. If he didn‚Äôt talk shit then he‚Äôd jus be another role player who misses shots once the stage lights turn on in Hollywood. But given all the shit he talks its normal to be upset. 

I know its been early but when u have a 2-10 start staying optimistic is really tough. Unless the team can cut some dudes and sign positive reinforcements theres not a lot that can be done. Either that or the team jus has to get better one way or the next the old fashion way. Bev needs to get benched like Nunn. With Dennis yeah he‚Äôll prob be a better starter than Bev cuz while he isn‚Äôt a shooter he is at least a bit more competent as a playmaker kinda but even then while he‚Äôll prob fit a bit better it still won‚Äôt be perfect given the fact he is coming back from thumb surgery with TB and we all seen how THT shot got broke after that shit.  Therefore its a tough spot to be in. Bev can‚Äôt start, Darvin Ham gotta pull the plug on him simple and plain. His defense isn‚Äôt smart enough to keep him in the game anymore if his offense is such a liability which is why Mateese Thybulle is getting benched in Philly too.",1.0

No GM takes him seriously, every GM in the league wants every asset to even engage with Lakers.


He lost every major trade he made. There‚Äôs no solution he can provide for this or next year.


He can‚Äôt sign single decent player in the offseason for years, I assume this is because he doesn‚Äôt have good relationships with agents. Only Klutch engages with him and takes advantage of his position.

I thought this team and organization needed someone like him to light a fire under their asses.

I was on board with trading THT for him because Pat helps the team now, while THT was a guy for the future and wasn‚Äôt ready to step into a huge role on a team with championship expectations. 

With the Pat Bev trade, I figured that pointed toward the direction of the Lakers making a move off of Russ and getting other role players like Buddy and Myles. So far though, the Lakers FO seems content with just letting this season play out as a disaster. 

If their mindset was always that this team wasn‚Äôt going to be real good and that would lead them to not being aggressive in trades, then why trade a young, 21 year old, who I think is going to develop into a really nice player, for a 34 year old who‚Äôs a win now player?

It‚Äôs just another example of this FO not having their priorities straight. This could very likely be another trade that will end up on the long list of failed ones that Pelinka has pulled off.",1.0

The lakers recently are constantly looking for the short cut to team building. They skip out on the smaller details. They mess up mid tier signings, trade important role players, and mess up min and Tax Payer signings. They attempt to cover up their incompetence by going after star after stars to avoid having to draft well, develop talent, retain talent, and identify value signings. 

To name a few mess ups below:

Losing Smaller Trades:
Zubacs trade
Thomas Bryant
Schroeder 

Overpaying big trades:
Russ Trade
AD trade

Missed resignings:
Wes Matthews
Caruso 
Lopez

Bad signings:
Most of the min guys last year
Nunn

Coach:
Being too cheap to hire Lue

TLDR: the constant third star pursuit is an attempt to cover up all of management‚Äôs mess ups. It‚Äôs the equivalent of the novice poker player going all in almost every hand. Once in a while you win (2020) by going all in but usually you fall on your face.",0.92

100,2022-11-11 18:45:50,ysj5is,[Delusional Thought] What if all this Jeanie/Rob vs Klutch/Bron feud talk is just FO‚Äôs desperate measure at gaining some trade leverage?,YoungEmperorLBJ,"I came into the season quite optimistic about the team, especially after watching the preseason and the first 8 games thinking even the results ain‚Äôt there, the team is making good progress and doing all the right things amid historically bad shooting luck. The guys are leaving everything on the court and that‚Äôs refreshing considering what we saw last season. But now I am utterly dejected and depressed. AD and Bron‚Äôs already shaky health is taking even more beating because FO just ignores what‚Äôs happening in the court. Especially after all the news about Jeanie being a cheapass bitch and Pelinka acting like her dog, I am losing whatever hope and optimism I have left. 

I admit I am a Lebron fan first. As an international fan I feel no particular attachment to any NBA city but I‚Äôve been following Bron since 06 and is captivated by his play, probably like how MJ captivated so many back in the 80s and 90s. I saw MJ in person at a Wizards game in 02 and even though he‚Äôs still MJ it was kinda sad watching him go out on a mediocre team. I feel the same about Bron‚Äôs final years now.

So here comes my extreme mental gymnastics. The Jeanie/Pelinka stuff that was leaked out could possibly be FO trying to gain the last bit of trade leverage. Here‚Äôs why:

1. Before the season, everyone was saying how lakers need to win some games with Russ to not seem desperate for trade. IMO that‚Äôs complete crap. Every opposing FO knows Russ will be traded no matter the record. Even if the Lakers are 19-1 before Thanksgiving, Russ is still a big negative in the playoffs. There is no leverage to be gained there. The only fringe scenario is that Russ plays so well that someone might want him. But given his salary, no team that‚Äôs competing will trade for him.

2. The only leverage the Lakers can get is if other FO actually believes Lakers aren‚Äôt trading their picks no matter what, which is exactly the message we‚Äôve gotten this past few days.

3. Lebron/Klutch putting a piece expressing their displeasure via Haynes further shows other FO that this whole thing is real. We know both of the Lakers picks are extremely valuable so they may wanna get what they can out of the lakers and finally start to negotiate in good faith.

I am probably just completely delusional.",1.0
