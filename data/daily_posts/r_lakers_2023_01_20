Past few years since Lebron joined, he has missed some time, Ad has missed some time, and our key starters/role players have also missed chunks of time due to injuries hurting the teams playoff and championship chances. 

Rams just won a superbowl, then got hit with many huge blows such as Stafford, Kupp, Obj in the playoffs last year, and other offensive pieces.

Chargers have also been dealing with their share of injuries, and the clippers have too with John wall, pg, and Kawhi (although those 3 have their history with injuries).
