Games leading up to the Lakers next matchup on Thursday involving west teams include:


Tuesday

Thunder @ Heat, 
Cavaliers @ Jazz, 
Suns @ Warriors, 
Magic @ Trail Blazers, 
Mavericks @ Clippers, 

Wednesday

Timberwolves @ Pistons, 
Pelicans @ Celtics, 
Spurs @ Grizzlies, 
Suns @ Nuggets, 
Rockets @ Kings, 

Thursday

Thunder @ 76ers, 
Mavericks @ Lakers, 
Cavaliers @ Trail Blazers

As long as LeBron is able to go off and get them back on track with a win against Dallas Thursday, this loss was ultimately meaningless in the west race as you can expect the teams in front of them to lose most if not all these games.",1.0

Ayton will probably be back but CP3 and Booker are probably going to be out for longer. Here's the Suns' next 9 games:

Tue, Jan 10     @Golden State

Wed, Jan 11	@Denver

Fri, Jan 13	@Minnesota

Mon, Jan 16	@Memphis

Thu, Jan 19	vs Brooklyn

Sat, Jan 21	vs Indiana

Sun, Jan 22	vs Memphis

Tue, Jan 24	vs Charlotte

Thu, Jan 26	vs Dallas

The only winnable games are vs Hornets and vs Brooklyn (because of KD's injury). They could win against Indy.

At worst (for us) they go, 3-6. At best, they go 1-8.",1.0

12,2023-01-09 18:55:09,107miwn,LeBron is 35 points away from hitting 38000 points,balzamon75,"LeBron is the youngest player in NBA history to reach 1K, 2K, 3K, 4K, 5K, 6K, 7K, 8K, 9K, 10K, 11K, 12K, 13K, 14K, 15K, 16K, 17K, 18K, 19K, 20K, 21K, 22K, 23K, 24K, 25K, 26K, 27K, 28K, 29K, 30K, 31K, 32K, 33K, 34K, 35K, 36K and 37K points. In 5 hours from now LeBron has the opportunity to lock in youngest to reach 38K regular season points. Another day another milestone.



Bonus stat: the next closest active player to LeBron in points is Kevin Durant (Carmelo has more but he's not playing) with 26684 regular season points. If KD was to continue to score 30 points in every game he played to reach 38K he would need 377 games. Or at least another 4.5 seasons at that pace, to match where LeBron is now.",1.0

20,2023-01-09 11:36:38,107ca3t,Are the Lakers just a trade or 2 away from being true contenders?,saiyansurvive,"With how great LeBron and our key role players have been performing lately. Even with injuries lately we are literally a win away from the play in. TB, Russ and Schroder have been fantastic. Once AD, Austin and Lonnie return we should be one of the scariest teams in the league, but we still need help on the wing. Obviously Pat Bev, Nunn are your ideal trade bait with maybe DJ too. So are the Lakers one or two or even 3 good role players (none of that talk of needing a 3rd star) from being a true contender not in the West but against whoever comes out of the east. 

If we do trade for Kuzma Iâ€™m not sure heâ€™ll be enough to push the Lakers to title contenders, but probably another wing too. I was all for the Charlotte trade for their wings, but Oubre is out and Hayward is just too much of a risk. Anyway lmk what your thoughts are",1.0
