7,2022-12-03 05:18:04,zb8h0j,Can we have an honest and updated discussion about Pelinka?,BrianC_,"For weeks, this guy was getting absolutely blasted here with people linking every sort of article nitpicking his mistakes.  I don't know how many times I've had to hear people say he sucks at asset management, loses every single deal on the fringes, and only has a job because of Kobe.

Has he been perfect?  No.  Absolutely not.  I've absolutely hated him for some of the mistakes he has made.  But, most of his mistakes have been small aside from Westbrook.

On the other hand, people constantly criticized him for having no idea how to build a team.  He built the 2019-2020 championship squad.  He built another contender in 2020-2021 -- and no, he did not break up the 2019-2020 team, players like Rondo decided to leave for more money.  He whiffed hard last year.  So many people wrote this roster off before it ever got the chance to mature.  But, after getting a chance to really prove themselves, this team is looking more and more like it's pretty well built.

At the end of the day, the goal of the GM is to build a good roster.  It's looking like he might be 3/4.  Some bitter haters will say Pelinka got lucky.  You can only get lucky so many times before it's not luck anymore.

As I see this roster, they're really 1 solid wing away from being objectively a strong roster.

I'll admit that I wasn't a fan of some of the signings.  I was scratching my hair out wondering why the team used their TPMLE on Lonnie Walker IV.  Some of the other signings I liked turned out to be duds -- JTA and Jones.  But, looking at how this team is built, it makes sense.  Everyone here has been calling Pelinka stupid for weeks.  How stupid does he look now?

Around the core and leadership of LeBron, AD, and Westbrook, you have a TON of athleticism, versatility, energy, and youth.  The role-players are high-motor guys that play the game HARD and with focused effort.

Between AD, LeBron, and Westbrook, you have 48 minutes a night of someone that can competently be the focal point of your offense.  Since moving to the bench, Westbrook's playmaking has been invaluable to guys like Wenyen Gabriel.

You have multiple guys that can create their own shot or create for others in spurts while also being respectable defenders.  Lonnie Walker IV.  Austin Reaves.

You have multiple guys that don't need the ball to succeed and will find their points in the gaps while playing respectable defense.  Pat Bev.  Wenyen Gabriel.  TBJ.

You have a ton of offensive finishing power in the paint and enough shooting after the team recovered from a historic shooting slump early in the season.

You have guys that will sell their ass on a street corner for a defensive stop.  That's the level of buy-in these guys are showing.

And, most importantly, everyone can accept their roles on this team because their role is so clearly defined by what they're good at.  That's a clear sign of a well built roster and a well coached team.

Watching these guys play has been a joy even if the record isn't great yet.  Just imagine for a second that Jones and JTA turned out to also be solid contributors.  This team would be rock solid with another back-up big and defensive wing.

I think unfortunately, this team is still not very deep.  But, that's just the reality of what happens when you have 3 max players.  We just have to hope that this team can stay healthy.

All this team really needs at this point is a bit more size -- ideally a bigger 3&amp;D swing.  And, they've got movable draft picks and enough mid-size salary value to get a deal done.  The fact that this team is so close to being a great roster says all it needs to about how it was built.",1.0

23,2022-12-03 04:08:23,zb77cs,Would a trade for Bogdanoviƒá and Bey from the Pistons be possible for LA?,CCPalmeri5,"Saw someone post possible trades the Lakers could make and this was one of them. At first I thought ‚Äúno way‚Äù, but after further evaluation I could see a world where the Lakers could get this done.

Bev, Nunn, and a 1st for Bogdanoviƒá and Bey

The salaries work out because Bey only costs a little under $3 million this season. It‚Äôs been reported that Detroit is willing to listen to offers on him, which was surprising at first, but he‚Äôs actually kinda struggling this year and has recently been benched. Bogdanoviƒá could be tricky because he‚Äôs likely going to draw a lot of interest around the league from contenders. Do they offer more than a 1st in the near future, idk, but I think the Lakers pick in ‚Äò27 or ‚Äò29 could be more valuable than a contender‚Äôs 1st in this upcoming draft or next.

So I guess I‚Äôm asking if this trade is realistic? I think it‚Äôd be awesome for the Lakers because you get 2 true wings who can shoot. Not sure what they offer on defense, but they‚Äôd both immediately be some of the Laker‚Äôs tallest players and Bogdanoviƒá would be a starter. What do y‚Äôall think?",1.0

26,2022-12-03 03:43:51,zb6qje,"If the Lakers are to make a trade, Pat Bev and/or Russ must be traded. Which would you prefer?",Apart-Bad-5446,"One or two of them have to be traded if the Lakers want to make a decent trade of value. With Russ playing very well off the bench, the notion that the Lakers have to give up picks to desperately get rid of Russ isn't as true as it was before the season started when almost everyone agreed that you had to give up at least two first if you wanted to trade Russ. Any team taking on Russ's contract is moot at this point because they'd be giving up equal salary and if it's a player they don't want long-term, Russ is a good salary dump for them. 

On the other hand, Pat Bev hasn't played well offensively but he's the only other player with any decent trade value in terms of making the salary work. I think if you're going to trade Bev, you'd have to look at adding Jones and Nunn as well. IMO, the Lakers are probably going to keep playing Bev heavy minutes so they can boost his trade value rather than benching him and giving the impression that the Lakers don't want him.

Which do you prefer? Giving up Russ+two first rounders or Pat Bev+Nunn and one first rounder? Or a combination of Pat Bev, Russ, and Nunn with two first rounders if they are able to land a huge haul?

Either way, a trade is likely imminent. The front office has to have seen what every other Lakers fan saw: This team has the potential to win the chip with just another couple of players.",1.0

55,2022-12-03 02:16:24,zb515x,Lebron‚Äôs defense,panashechd,"I don‚Äôt know if anybody else is noticing this but what is Lebron doing defensively? He backpeddled into the post TWICE to double team Holiday leaving Lopez wide open on the three which resulted in Lopez hitting both shots totalling 6 easy points. Why does he keep doing this? Especially when a defender is already on Holiday? Why is he leaving one of the better shooting big men wide open then complaining when he knocks down shots? 

In one play, he didn‚Äôt switch on Middleton, which cause Beverly to overplay, leaving Holiday wide open in the corner. Khris got the easy pass and Holiday got another 3. Then he had one possession where he backed off Portis entirely resulting in another easy 3. Let‚Äôs not forget Holidays open three because Lebron didn‚Äôt run back on defense. Lebron is killing the Lakers with his lazy defensive effort, he‚Äôs easily allowed 4-5 easy threes this game alone either because he didn‚Äôt bother playing defense or didn‚Äôt commit to the switch. 

I hope somebody in the locker room calls him out when they review this game because it‚Äôs been so obvious and yet I don‚Äôt see any Lakers fans talking about it. He‚Äôs routinely messing up defensively then blaming other people, I‚Äôd be pissed if I was his teammate. This is purely a critical analysis, I‚Äôm not a Lebron hater, saying he should be traded or anything like that. But his constant lapses on defense can‚Äôt be ignored and it‚Äôll lose the Lakers this game if he‚Äôs not careful.",1.0

I know he isn't so much of a ""bruiser"", but it'd be beautiful to see. I feel he wants to mentally, but hesitant physically.

I think he'll show more flashes tonight.",1.0

66,2022-12-02 08:12:31,zafrar,The ONLY legitimate trade / plan to keep Reaves and Walker next free agency. Thoughts?,willsteves,"We only have 25 M in cap space next year. If we bring in a player worth 20M, That means we probably won‚Äôt be able to resign Reaves or Walker next year‚Ä¶

Here‚Äôs a legitimate plan to keep Reaves and Walker. Trade Bev, and a FRP for Kuz at 13M. (Or another player at about 13 M). That means we can use up to 12 M to resign Walker, then the MLE at 6M for Reaves. Any player traded higher salary means we can‚Äôt resign these prices. Now if I‚Äôm wrong on the cap , basically trade to have enough for Walker at around 12M , using the MLE for Reaves.
Then we only have vet mins, then comes bird rights‚Ä¶

Unfortunately, use bird rights to resign Westbrook and Nunn. Maybe Russ at 10M, we can resign Nunn to 120% of his current salary , so about 7.2 M. Benchbrook is great 6th man material. And Nunn didn‚Äôt just forget basketball, although he sucks this year so far, he‚Äôll probably be better than a vet min and should be able to turn around eventually. We‚Äôre already capped just resigning Reaves and Walker after a trade. Might as well.

Thoughts? I believe the cap is 25M. If I‚Äôm wrong show me your thoughts!",1.0
