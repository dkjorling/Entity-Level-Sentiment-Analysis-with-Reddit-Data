What a thrilling start to the season. Nobody could have predicted this kind of start and I mean literally nobody.
We're winning games, playing a winning style of basketball, developing young players and winning habits all at the same time.
Things are practically perfect...
Except this sub is bumming me out. After every dub I come to ) r/lakersto revel in victory. Yet after even wins, there are several disgruntled posts regarding things like: westbrook' playing time,lebron playing time, worrying aboutrob pelinka fit in the rotation, trading Kyle Kuzma,Oubre‚Äôs inability to finish at the rim, and so on.
These are all
legitimate conversations but there is a better time and place to show concern and complain. The goal of the games is TO WIN. When the team WINS, the fans should be HAPPY. Not WHINY. There's no guarantee that this season will continue going well. A number of things could happen to deter the team after an incredible start. So please, I'm begging you guys, enjoy this incredible and unlikely start to the season. Sections of the fan base are coming off as entitled and unappreciative. And I don't know how Blazer fans can feel so entitled after the last couple seasons. Try to be humble and appreciate what's happened so far.",1.0

My opinion:

Trade Lebron for McCollum and our picks, add fillers and sweeteners as needed.

Trade for Westbrook/AD for Kyrie/Simmons.

Turn around and trade Simmons for Kawhi and West.

We then banish Kyrie by playing hard poker with him and the media (this might be the hardest thing to do TBH). Take the L for league, W for La La Land.

KD and Westbrook get to play decent ball for an audience that‚Äôs hungry for stability.

AD might play. It‚Äôs up to him and his body, no matter where he is, TBH.

Lebron probably catches up to MJ and passes him in goat status by leading a young developing team into a ring or two and as an aged star in a struggling market.

Hire solid coaching and development. Nash, Vogel, and Snyder are available. Pay them very well, and have them develop a new
Team culture. Give them full control, no imperative to win, just develop solid players. Scout deep into the second round and the far reaches of the earth. Diamonds in the rough.

Laker fans stop being entitled and accept a proper tank. People will say this is LA and stars want to be here. It doesn‚Äôt matter if we field shitty teams. And they need to get it in their head, Tatum has a good chance of leading Boston to a few rings. We get two solid veterans in Kawhi and McCollum, and they don‚Äôt have to win, just play well in the biggest market and lead young talent.

This team being 2-9 if you told me that at some point they're gonna get to 24-24 tbh I'll take it. In order for this team to get over .500 they'll need 2 separate mini 4 or 5 game win streaks with maybe 1 loss in between winning 10 out of 12 games in a stretch.

The starting 5 gives u decent size and shooting. And the bench gives u somewhat the same thing and can be plugged in here and there with the main guys.

Sign Lebron in 2019, tell him you will give him playmakers so he doesn‚Äôt have to ply off ball. Fill out roster around young guys with 0 shooting just more guys who need the ball in their hands. Burn valuable assets for marginal shooting.

2020. Trade for AD, built a team that slotted correctly next to bron and AD. Exhaust most assets currently needed. 

2021 - Address need for a little extra scoring without giving up too much. 21-6 before Bron injury. Injuries decimate the team not shooting. 

2022- overcorrect by a wide margin by bringing in Westbrook, more importantly Westbrooks contract, and get rid of everyone else who slotted correctly and sign a bunch of shooters who can‚Äôt play defense. Burn last of essential assets for this era. 


23- Burning all those assets finally catches up to them. Afraid to burn the last assets of the decade and pay repeater tax, gamble on what they know didn‚Äôt work hoping superstardom can bail them out. The team is younger, but still can‚Äôt slot correctly around Bron and AD. FO still believes a singular player can turn this around instead of 2-3.",1.0

Lebron is aging and injuries are starting to become more frequent cause he‚Äôs playing way too much minutes. AD is regressing as well he‚Äôs just no the same guy, and these minutes are also taking a toll on his body. 

If lebron and ad are gonna be on this roster we should do everything to surround them with the best team possible. This team isn‚Äôt even close, it‚Äôs full of a bunch of rejects from other teams and young inexperienced players.

* missed playoffs 7 of 9 years (and this being the 10th year seems likely that‚Äôll be 8 out of 10 years)

* Have only advanced past 1st rouns once in 9 years.

She just secretly gave Rob Pelinka a four year extension this offseason after missing the playoffs. Why didn‚Äôt they announce that? ‚Ä¶.

She has Pelinka as both GM and Pres of B-Ball Opps why? Because it‚Äôs cheaper to have one person do two peoples job.

She has her longtime best friends husband in the small inner circle of 3-4 total people. He‚Äôs not qualified. She‚Äôs never interviewed other more qualified candidates. When pressed about this she uses sexism as a veneer to shield her ineptitude.

She‚Äôs in the bottom 1/3 of the least liquid owners in the NBA.

And has ran the team like a business with zero intention to win or face accountability.

Fire Rob if you want, that won‚Äôt change the fact that Jeanie is the rotten head at the top.

‚ÄúTrade LeBron‚Äù. Yeah you do that without his willingness and say bye to future Klutch biz. When we already have an uneasy relationship w CAA as it is (Paul George, Randle and DLO issues with Aaron Mintz).

She has been way worse than Jim.

And Jeanie is completely shitting on the legacy her father built for this org ‚Äî a legacy that was GIVEN to her and that she has only completely fumbled for basically a decade straight.

You have one of the top 3 players in history in LeBron still in great shape and one of the most talented big men in the league in AD. They already showed you in the 2019-2020 season that just by being surrounded by DECENT players, they can go and win a chip. And yet here we are, with the FO doing the complete opposite of what he should have been, putting G-League level players around LBJ and AD. Seriously, how can you be so incompetent? I can't understand, it almost seems like they're ruining this team on purpose. It doesn't make any sense to me.

If at the beginning of the season they had made the trades and found good role players to support LBJ and AD (good shooters, decent defenders and a Center) and we would be contenders right now. I still believe that if the trades are made even at this point in the season, we could easily be a playoff team. And in the playoffs, having guys like LBJ and AD on your team, well, anything can happen. Then next season you make the right moves here and there, and you have a top contender team.
