Remember that AD is a fundamental part of that legendary 2020 Lakers championship team that decimated the league---that team was so great and dominant that Pelinka wanted to rebuild immediately to alleviate himself of boredom from winning so easily. People yawn from boredom, complained how Miami in the finals got absolutely no chance. Winning got so easy that Rob eventually just traded everybody to make NBA basketball fair and exciting again. 

Don't be shock in the coming days when Lebron returns to form too and goes full supersaiyan.

6,2022-11-14 07:14:14,yurr9q,"Great to See a W, But the Nets Missed a RIDICULOUS Amount of Open Shots",Trustthefundamentals,"**Positives From This Game:**  


* AD looked for his shot early and often against a team where that absolutely had to be the gameplan on offense
* AD and Westbrook only played about half of Westbrook's minutes together (more minute staggering between the two leads to better success and more floor spacing for AD to work)
* Reaves handled the ball on offense more, Westbrook less. ONLY 9 TURNOVERS largely due to this decision 
* Lakers shot 41% from three as a team, particularly great encouraging shooting from Lonnie
* Troy Brown Jr, Austin Reaves, and Lonnie Walker IV continue to play solid man on man defense.  Shoutout to Brown especially, who led the team with a +22 night on a team leading 36 minutes
* Gabriel's offensive post game continues to surprise. It looks like he's really starting to trust that very few people are going to block his 7'1"" wingspan

&amp;#x200B;

**Negatives From This Game:**  


* The semi blowout score is misleading. The Nets bricked open look after open look all night. If Darvin Ham is feeding the team praise for incredible defense, he's wrong. Sloppy rotations allowed multiple Nets to get open looks whenever they wanted. Sumner may have been the Lakers' MVP for the night. Off-night for KD, along with DNP's for Irving, Simmons, Curry (2nd, 3rd, &amp; 4th best players). Plus Claxton only played half the game before leaving
* 116 points for the Lakers looks great on paper, but 25 assists on 44 field goals is pretty meh. Still a lot of standing around from the supporting cast, and hoping AD hero balls them to a win, which he did this time. The Nets defense was paper thin as well, easily the worst the Lakers have faced
* Westbrook shot 4-15 with 4 turnovers. In all honesty, he could have had more like 7 turnovers. His highlights look great when he threads the needle with his passes, but the high risk/high reward decisions he makes are still detrimental to the Lakers' success. He continues to look more like last season's Russ after an encouraging sign that he was dialing back his gambley style for his first few games off the bench this season. His style of play and decisions continue, in my opinion, to prevent the Lakers from playing like at least a .500 team. Don't let a big dunk, surprising three, or occasional highlight pass fool you
* Nunn looked rough on an 0-4 night with none of his shots having a chance to go in. He still doesn't look fully healthy, based on how he's moving on the court and making half-hearted cuts",1.0

I think how Ham is getting AD the ball is terrible to be honest. He has him setting a million screens all game instead of letting him work in space from 16 feet and down and use his guard skills. Also they need to get him the ball on the post early in the clock like how the Sixers do for Embiid. To me it feels like they can do a better job at getting him open looks from the mid range.

60,2022-11-13 20:06:12,yucg84,Why does the thought of Bron taking a paycut this past summer to help this team blasphemous?,TorontoRaptors34,"I say this because Bron is a fuckin billionaire. Rob and Jeanie knew the Westbrook situation made it tough to attain role players for the squad. Ion see how its unfair to ask Bron if u really want to win help this team get better add 2-3 really good solid pieces like a real big and 3/D guys that would truly help this team out. 
Bron has a good relationship with PJ Tucker who played with Russ in Hous and is still fairly solid vet guy who played for Darvin Ham in Milwuake you don‚Äôt think if they had some money that he‚Äôd come to the Lakers over the Sixers. I just checked his contract and he has some security but I believe in Brons ability to get guys around the league. I think Draymond would prob play with Bron if he could lets be honest. PJ is 37 but still balls out in his role and is a champion. He can hit corner 3s as well as do the dirty work sorta what u want Melo‚Äôs role to be with defense. As well as Otto Porter Jr too. He‚Äôs a dynamic wing who can guard almost all positions just won a ring with GS and coulda helped AD huge as a FA. Bron signing an extension wasn‚Äôt wrong its just the amount of money. Maybe even Jamychal Green who signed with GS who can shoot and defend. Those 3 guys woulda been perfect even with the Center position being somewhat flimsy. 

I get that somethings are bigger than sports and that u want to get paid what ur worth. However, LeBron is 37 going on 38. So far this season he hasn‚Äôt looked like himself sure he can still put up numbers put they aren‚Äôt nearly as impactful. I also get he is LeBron James but this is also a team sport and guys like Tim Duncan took cuts all the time. James Harden just took a pay cut and umm its not that bright in Philly but still he made the effort.

Frankly AD should take a cut too given his injury but him being under contract makes it hard. WB i don‚Äôt blame given the uncertainty in his situation. There were rumors of him being out the league so why would he risk his career when he knew the drama surrounding the FO potentially wanting him gone. 
I do feel awful for Bron at this time and its a shame hes my favorite player of all time next to Kobe and Id hate to see him go out like this. But I do feel this past summer him taking a paycut woulda significantly helped the teams chances if he really wanted to win. Tbh he is worth a billion dollars off the court and continues to gain as we speak so i personally don‚Äôt see how him takin the cut would affect him personally. Maybe its jus the fan in me talking but I do feel its worth the ? And isn‚Äôt unfair to ask.",1.0

I haven‚Äôt seen many lakers fans talk about this. No realistic trade will make them championship contenders with this core and current roster construction.
