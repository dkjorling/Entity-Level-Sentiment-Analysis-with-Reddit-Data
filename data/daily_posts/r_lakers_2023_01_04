2,2023-01-05 06:12:01,103rhv5,Role players love playing with aggressive Russ,MITWestbrook,"Russ did have 7 turnovers. But at least he takes risks and tries to pass to guys that are cutting. He focuses on trying to force passes to his role players.

Never seen Wenyen so energized when Russ probably had 3-4 turnovers trying to pass it to him. It keeps Wenyen energized to keep cutting and trying to catch the ball and make plays.

Same goes for Nunn, Schroeder, Thomas Bryant and crew. They know Russ will be the guy willing to risk turnovers to force feed the ball. It makes the guys feel they should keep moving off ball and cutting.

Now we don't need 48 minutes of this. And it's a good change of pace from Lebron's free lance offense. Just wanted to call it out.

Russ is the perfect playmaker for bigs and players that constantly cut and try to get open.",1.0

Even Westbrook cleaned up the turnovers in the second half and had a really solid game.

This is obviously not sustainable without our stars but this was a fun one for true longtime fans",1.0

”They obviously are not willing to trade the picks,” Howard Beck reported. “And I’ve heard rumblings — and they’re only rumblings, so I don’t want people to go too far with this or go crazy with the aggregation — but a couple people around the league have told me in recent weeks that they believe that the front office has essentially been told not to trade the picks. That they’re guarding those.”

30,2023-01-04 16:12:04,1037f0e,We have to trade Westbrook but what would you do?,Freeeecurry,"Fact: We have to trade Russ

Fact 2: No trades have been made yet

Fact 3: A Team with Healthy Lebron &amp; AD is a definite contender 

Fact 4: We will not extract full value out of those 2 picks and Russ until near the deadline as selling teams have no obligation to accommodate a trade now for the lakers to strengthen their  record

Fact 5: Big man lineups work, not the small guard ones. The lineup should be Lebron Bev TBJ Bryant and AD once AD returns. 

Fact 6: If Dennis was promised minutes in his condition for coming here then add his expiring to nunn and Westbrooks contracts when they’re traded as Dennis is currently tanking the starting lineup. We can all agree he’d be good off the bench but if talking about ego’s he has one as well
