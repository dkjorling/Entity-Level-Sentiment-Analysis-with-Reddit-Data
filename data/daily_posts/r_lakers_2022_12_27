0,2022-12-28 06:35:51,zx2lwb,Shoutouts to Doncic,letsnotargue,"Guy has easily been my favorite individual player in the nba since Kobe retired, and I couldn‚Äôt help but think kobe is so proud of one of his favorite young‚Äôns watching him just tear up the league. 


Doncic is the player that reminds me of Kobe the most (but without any frobe era) in terms of play style in the second half of Kobe‚Äôs career (~2003+) and I love watching him play and shit tonight, he was pulling Kobe-esque moves and hustle left and right. Wish he could‚Äôve worked with Doncic more. 


(Just miss Kobe and would he would‚Äôve brought to the scene as a retired legend and of course what Gianna would‚Äôve brought to the global wnba scene. And of course their individual personal lives. Shoutouts to any families who have lost loved ones, your courage and strength cannot be understated.)",1.0

And yet because of only 1 bubble ring, it's sad to say that LeBron will never be considered one of the All Time Great Lakers along with people like Shaq, Kareem, Kobe, Magic etc..

and none of it is his fault (as a player)! It makes me angry that LeBron will somehow be looked as not as respected when if he is doing this on a team like the Suns, Grizzlies, Raptors etc he would be seen as one of the biggest saving graces of their franchise and organization. 

Who does this to an ALL TIME GREAT and potentially the GOAT?",1.0

Obviously this ultimately did not happen as he went back to Cleveland and they ended up spending most of their time on LaMarcus Aldridge and Carmelo Anthony.

The team had cap space for 2 stars I believe and let‚Äôs say they signed both 29 year-old LeBron and 30 year-old Melo. What seed do you think that team with Kobe in his last couple of years wnxs during the 2014-15 season and how far do you think they go?",1.0
