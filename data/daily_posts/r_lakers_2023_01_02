4,2023-01-03 04:16:21,101xttf,Reaves and Schroeder should swap minutes,randomthrowaway5500,"Schroeder has provided quality minutes this season but I think Ham is overstretching him. He played 37 minutes tonight (many of those minutes with Lebron) while Reaves only played 22 minutes. Reaves is a much better choice to optimize Lebron, not only is he a more capable shooter but he's shown that he has the playmaking chops to be a serviceable secondary creator. I just don't see the point in playing Schroeder starter minutes at Reaves' expense when Schroeder is a worse shooter, passer, and defender.",1.0

8,2023-01-03 03:42:02,101x45h,PBPStats.. start Lonnie over Schroeder. Schroeder and Russ should play together,MITWestbrook,"https://www.pbpstats.com/wowy-combos/nba?TeamId=1610612747&amp;Season=2022-23&amp;SeasonType=Regular%2BSeason&amp;PlayerIds=203471,201976,1629022,201566,203076

Full stats here. Was looking at net ratings without Anthony Davis. In all seriousness， most lineups work with AD healthy.

So first principles: Lonnie great on offense but bad D. Pat Bev spot up shooter and great D. Russ and Schroeder are both mainly POA defenders but not great help defenders. Both have similar offensive games that play off each other.

So the net ratings don't lie. Lonnie with Russ and/or Schroeder just leads to bad defense. Lonnie gets lost too much. Both Russ and Schroeder are POA defenders and can't make up for Lonnie's mistakes.

So Ham needs to stop that. Just play Schroeder and Russ together.

Pat Bev is perfect though. He takes charges and plays help defense. He also can stop POA. So he makes up for all of Lonnie's mistakes on D. It's one of the few positive net rating lineups without AD.

Make the change Ham.",1.0

I don't think we'll ever see another basketball player with this much wear and tear on their body have this production at that age. Also if you add up his post season games he's played like 3 extra seasons of basketball. So his body is really closer to 41 or 42 than 38.",1.0

It’s no secret that the league doesn’t really want to help out the Lakers, they actually bitch and cry when the team makes a solid move. Then you compound that with LBJ joining the team and then add the Clutch factor into the pot and the Laker hate is at a all time high and the rest of the league is reveling at the teams current predicament.

Do you really think that a new GM will suddenly have teams lining up to send their players here? Or a new owner?",1.0
