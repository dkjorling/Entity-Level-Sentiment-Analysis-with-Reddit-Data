The pieces we‚Äôve picked up have performed as advertised so far. Specifically Vanderbilt whose offensive numbers aren‚Äôt great, but having a lock down defender alongside AD has done wonders for our team. Speaking of which, AD bro I knew he still had it in him.

22,2023-03-08 18:27:57,11m3y72,Some observations,CoatNo4499,"Finally sleeping good after that win yesterday but the job‚Äôs not finished. Anyway I want to note a few things:

1) Rui Hachimura does not get the recognition he deserves imo. 

2) Dennis Schr√∂der is honestly so good. His stats might look ass on paper but when you watch him, he hits some really big shots ngl

3) AD needs to be dominant like he has been, but I often see him (often meaning relatively, more than I‚Äôd like to see) be a little passive, maybe that‚Äôs for the best because we don‚Äôt want another injury, idk, maybe I‚Äôm wrong?

4) The shooters were horrible yesterday but I don‚Äôt wanna grill them, instead, I‚Äôd hope that the coaching staff would recognize weaknesses and make adjustments.

6) I love the defense, it‚Äôs been great for the most part but sometimes I can‚Äôt stand to see opposing players just jog by and make a layup (especially happened vs warriors and yesterday too)

5) I have no idea when Bron will be back but this code is amazing. AR and Vanderbilt is amazingly consistent, I have no complaints. 

6) Beasley was ass yesterday but I have high hopes, just one bad game,

Let‚Äôs fucking go. We missed an opportunity against the Wolves but I honestly think AD is unstoppable against most teams bc of his dominance and skills. We can win against Raptors, Knicks, Pelicans, Rockets, Mavs, and Magic.",1.0

[Five man lineups vs the Grizzlies \(3\/7\)](https://preview.redd.it/64ups6oqpjma1.png?width=910&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=5dc3344b46e31f0a4b9062d685f5158cf4e9c952)

Some things I noticed:

That closing group was a +25 on the night. I had to double and triple check my code to make sure that wasn't an error. Everything just seemed to be clicking for the Lakers with that lineup. Rui was hitting his midrange shot which helps space the floor, Troy and Reaves were lights out from downtown, just beautiful basketball. 

Our worst lineup occurred when Ham decided to go small ball with Vando at the five. While I understand we have a lack of depth at center with Bamba out, it was rough to see. Gabriel was not much better, playing a role in our other four worst lineups, ending with -15 on the night. I think this sub heavily overrates Gabriel because he was such a bright spot during those dark Westbrook days, but I don't think he warrants a spot in the rotation when everyone is healthy.

Non-lineup related, but I wanted to talk about the phenomenal job Schroder did on Bane. I was checking my phone at halftime to see if something happened to Bane because I barely noticed him in the entire first half. Bane only scored his 3/14 field goals during a stretch in the third or fourth quarter when Schroder was on the bench and he drove past Reaves for some easy layups. I don't recall him scoring, or making any sort of play while Schroder was on the court. Absolutely locked down.

Speaking of Reaves, he wasn't bad defensively by any stretch of the imagination. Bane may be too quick for Austin, which is why he shouldn't be guarding him in the first place, but Reaves did some excellent work on Dillon Brooks. 

&amp;#x200B;

The depth and versatility of this roster is truly something to behold when fully healthy. Assuming LeBron and AD are healthy, our closing lineup \*should\* consist of those two, a forward, and two guards. If our opponent is someone like Dallas or Phoenix, we can throw Vanderbilt at their best player to harass and pester them all night. If not, we have Rui who has a beautiful midrange game and can hit the three occasionally. For the remaining two guards, we have D'Angelo Russell, Malik Beasley, Dennis Schroder, and Austin Reaves. Each of which provide unique qualities either offensively or defensively. This is all without mentioning Troy Brown Jr, who could slot either as a SG or SF. He has been hitting 44% from 3 since the all star break, along with playing crucial defense. Truly so much to be optimistic about. We are 7-3 since the trade, 3-0 with LeBron, 3-1 with Dlo.",1.0

AD with a monster 30-22 game to push the team into the 9th seed and a playin spot, that is what you need from your stars when you're playing must win games, and AD showed again why when healthy and in rhythm he's top 5. 

The Lakers are 7-3 since the trade deadline, #1 in defence in that time. This is with missing Bron and D'Lo for almost all of these 10 games. Just incredible momentum to build off on in the coming days.

2-1 on yesterday's rooting guide with the 76ers beating the Timberwolves and the Mavericks taking care of the Jazz, the loss was from the Thunder getting a win vs the Warriors but i guess that helps us anyway so we take it kind of. 

For today it's a 4 game guide as we hope for the Lakers to get some help to move up into the 5th/6th seed region.

**Rooting Guide.**

1. **Pelicans(+1.5)** over the Mavericks
2. **Celtics(-10.5)** over the TrailBlazers
3. **Suns(-13.5)** over the Thunder
4. **Raptors(+3.5)** over the Clippers

Mavericks helped us yesterday but today is the day they have to lose, also i know it feels icky to root for the celtics, just don't watch the game and check to score at the end of the night. 

2 days off for the team now, D'Lo back on Friday. Job's not finished. 

GO LAKERS!!!
