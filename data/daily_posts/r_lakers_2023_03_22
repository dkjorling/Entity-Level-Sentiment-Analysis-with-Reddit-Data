On 10/18 shooting.

Demanded the ball, got the W. Even the broadcast and coach ham said we stopped settling and just starting working in and around the post.

We need that AD. Good to great on both ends, not just one. Props to you for answering the call.

Shoutout to Reaves, and DLo as well both had highly efficient games.
