I don't want his contributions to go under the radar with how badly he's been shooting.

72,2022-10-24 15:09:44,ycdqdh,We should be thankful for the brutal opening schedule and I’ll tell you why,GreatAmerican1776,"Hear me out. The way I see it this season could have started one of two ways:

Scenario 1: Brutal opening schedule (and a key injury to Schroeder) leads to a record of 3-11 after 14 games. Coach Ham knows Westbrook is unplayable and continues forcing him into crucial game situations to leave no doubt that he either needs to made inactive or traded away as soon as possible. Schroeder comes back from injury just as Russ is traded away for shooting help and the Lakers surge to a .500 record by Christmas. A Christmas day win propels the team into the back half of the season and they become the team nobody wants to play in the playoffs.

Scenario 2: Hypothetical easy start to the season leaves the Lakers at 8-6 after 14 games. The record gives hope to the idea that Westbrook is good for the team and Lakers feel no urgency to change anything. This leads to a record of something like 23-35 at the all star break, at which point it is too late to fix anything. The team is now surrounded by bad vibes and ends up missing out on the play in game.

Now, we would all choose scenario 1, right? That’s where I’m at. I’m officially rooting for more embarrassing, painful losses that will force Pelinka’s hand. I’m sure Russ is a nice guy, but his game is completely broken. We cannot run from the pain. We must face the pain and come out the other side stronger. Give us all the hard teams right now.",0.86
