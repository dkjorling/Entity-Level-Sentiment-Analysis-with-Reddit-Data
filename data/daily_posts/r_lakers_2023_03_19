KCP and Danny Green even when they didn‚Äôt have good nights on offense, would very good defenders which is why it made sense.

Beasley does none of that while being an even worse shooter than Danny Green was here in 2020. Reaves on the other hand, not only is a much more consistent offensive talent, but already a near elite defensive guard according to advanced statistics (as well as eye test the majority of times).

We have definitely been worse in 2014-2018 but the expectations weren't there since Kobe was hurt and we could watch the kids develop. For 2005-2007, it was a treat to watch Kobe go off, but once again little expectations to compete for a title without a 2nd allstar.

Timberwolves, Clippers and Warriors all lost last night. The jazz won and the Lakers are now 11th out of the play in spots.

**Rooting Guide.**

1. **Suns(+1.5)** over the Thunder
2. **Rockets(+5.5)** over the Pelicans
3. **Trailblazers(+3.5)** over the Clippers

If Lakers lose today the rooting guide ends. What motivated me to start this was the prospect of Lakers getting up to the 6th seed, i really don't care if they make only the play in.

GO LAKERS!!!
