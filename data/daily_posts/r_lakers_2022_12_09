1. This team has some fight in them - the way they were able to come back and force OT was amazing. Never gave up even when down double digits in the fourth

2. AD is a freakin monster - clearly our best player

3. AD, LBJ, Russ combo is pretty damn good when it‚Äôs working - their chemistry is starting to show which is nice, hopefully it only continues to get better

4. We need some shooters badly - Reeves had a great game today but definitely can‚Äôt rely on him to be that guy. Someone else needs to step up, or we‚Äôre really just one player away from being legit 

5. LeBron is definitely declining a bit - still great overall but doesn‚Äôt have the same level of consistency. We‚Äôll have to rely on AD a bit more",1.0
