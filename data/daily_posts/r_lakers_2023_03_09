LeBron can still get his points but they’re not the same impactful points like 2020, he’s still great tho. Tbh he might not know how to be the #2 option. Imo this team will go all the way if the offense runs through AD, he’s the ultimate cheat code.",1.0

12,2023-03-10 01:55:12,11nb6aq,Non Bron/AD Resigning Top Ten Priorities in the Offseason.,ReidMcLain,"Here’s my rough list 

1. D’Angelo Russell (still needs to prove he’s worth 31m, but could be that third star).

2. Rui Hachimura (Young stud for cheap $6m???, he’s our Kyle Kuzma 2.0 Three level scorer, hard to find elite YOUNG scoring wings). 

3. Jarred Vanderbilt (Defense is god tier, only paid $4m could get a pay bump, if he learns a 3 pointer could become a defensive anchor).

4. Austin Reaves (He’s cheap but he’s so impactful for $2m, he makes 2-3 incredible defensive plays a night and can lock up some stars, second highest defensive rating on out team besides AD also has that bag on offense).

5. Troy Brown Jr (This could be controversial but I love his game he’s a $2m PERFECT 3-D player, if he plays against under guards his size is a problem on defense, give a slight pay bump but don’t sell the farm for him).

6. Dennis Schroder (Great guard who’s really clutch but some games he disappears, Best value player on our team for $2m but I fear we won’t be able to afford him if his value goes up).

7. Malik Beasley (he’s the shooter shooter we desperately needed but I’m concerned about his shot selection, I don’t know if he fits our team, where’s the defense? Also $16m?? We could easily better allocate that keeping other players or signing someone else).

8. Mo Bamba (I love Mo Bamba, I love his length shooting and want to keep him on our roster so bad but it’s hard to justify $10m for an injured prone backup center).

9. Lonnie Walker (This one is tough, but Lonnie is just a better THT, an undersized forward that has a better jumpshot. It just seems he’s out there trying to get his. I almost never see a Lonnie defensive highlight, buried on our roster for $6.5m that could be used on some guys on the top).

10. Wenyan Gabriel (Acceptable center for $2m, athletic can play defense but can feel lost at times, if we can’t keep Bamba resign him especially if AD might be injured for center depth but he’s a replaceable talent).

Do you guys think there’s any validity to this? I really hope not because they’ve always seemed so close that I kind of wrote it off as AD being frustrated with the roster and the constant losing for two years.
