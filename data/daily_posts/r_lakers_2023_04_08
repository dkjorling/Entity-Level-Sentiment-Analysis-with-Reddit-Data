The focus and attention to detail has really been a problem even after trade deadline so maybe adding a fun guy, good vibes guy that can lift the vibes up even on a loss especially come playoffs. This team is still young and tho chemistry is turning well, it still in the process of being great.",1.0

25,2023-04-08 17:19:05,12fs9a5,Would facing the Grizzlies really be so bad?,Dig_Bick_Beau,"So the most likely scenario with the few games remaining puts the highest likelihood of the Lakers ending up the 7 seed (and likely facing a Zion-less pelicans in the play-in which I see as very winnable). I know everyone wants to face the Kings in the first round - despite them having the top offense in NBA history - but I don‚Äôt see the Grizzlies as an intimidating matchup either since our roster matches up so much better now post-trade deadline. And if Lakers win that series it then matches them up with the winner of Kings/Warriors (the likeliest 3/6 matchup), both teams I still think we match up well against, avoiding the Suns/Clippers winner and the Nuggets (who I believe are severely underrated despite being the 1 Seed) until the WCF, allowing us to build our chemistry a bit more against teams I think we match up lineup-wise and maybe wear them down after what will be tougher series than the Kings/Warriors winner. So why is everyone acting as if ending up the 7 seed is so tragic (aside from having to play in the play-in)?",1.0

28,2023-04-08 16:04:01,12fq7ng,[Stats] Austin aka All-Star Reaves next year in only his 3rd Season?,JanuaryCarl,"In only his 2nd season, Stu Lantz has labeled Austin Reaves as the Lakers 3rd best player, many may argue 2nd, and at times he was the best Laker when AD struggled when Bron was out.

Next season, AR will only get better, I‚Äôm guessing a better shooter since he always complains about missing 1 or 2 free throws postgame.

If his numbers post All-star break are any indication of his future (he‚Äôs averaging 18 points on a super efficient 57/42/85 split with a +144) and Lakers having a winning record, couldn't he be All-Star Reaves next season in only his 3rd year?
