1,2023-01-25 06:45:54,10ksenj,"If Lebron played each position his entire career, where would he be all-time at that position?",aaronjaffe,"Jordan was the best shooting guard of all-time, and probably the best at his position relative to other players at their positions. But Bron would‚Äôve been an all-time great literally anywhere you put him.  

1 - #1 all time at point guard. He‚Äôd be better than Magic, and it wouldn‚Äôt even be that close.  

2 - #3 all time at shooting guard. Michael and Kobe were both better pure scorers than Bron.

3 - #1 all time at the 3. This is more or less his position when he‚Äôs not playing center because the entire lineup besides him is 6‚Äô tall.  

4 - #4 all time. This is a tough one. Tim Duncan is definitely better than Bron would‚Äôve been as a dedicated 4. Garnett too. Bron would‚Äôve been better than either Malone or Barkley. And Giannis is obviously better than Bron now, but peak Bron? And where does Dirk fit in to all of this. 

5 - Kareem, Russel, Wilt, Shaq, and Hakeem all definitely better. Ditto for David Robinson. I think he‚Äôd have been better than Moses Malone and definitely Ewing. Not sure about Dwight and Zo (nba top 75 order be damned). And he wouldn‚Äôt be better than Jokic or Embiid. #9 all time at center.  

There‚Äôs that old story about the Trailblazers who drafted Sam Bowie ahead of Jordan. A scout was begging them to draft Jordan, but the Blazers were like, ‚ÄúWe need a center.‚Äù Scout goes, ‚ÄúPlay him at center.‚Äù But if it had been Lebron I‚Äôm convinced they could have actually played him at center and he would‚Äôve been top 10 all time at the position.",1.0
2,2023-01-25 06:43:56,10ksdkb,Why would other teams trade for Westbrook?,830res_at_dorsia,"Other teams watch out games too. If they are aware of our desperation to remove Westbrook, why would they accept the trades we envision? 

They would see through our urgency, starve us out and take every piece of asset we have, or give away much less for our 2 unprotected first round picks.

Yes, we are ruined until some imbecile GM makes us a call after Westbrook records a meaningless triple double sometime next month. 

So thanks Rob Pelinka for the amazing Westbrook acquisition. But who cares? Our dear Rob got a lucrative extension so that is all that matters.",1.0

We had AD primarily play the 4 for 25 minutes a game with Javale and Dwight playing the 5. We‚Äôd close with AD at the 5. We have to admit whether we like or not that he‚Äôs an injury risk and the best way to help AD is to not have him bump against centers for 40 minutes a game. 

That kept him healthy through the regular season. Remember against Miami we were praying for the series to end as AD was hurting by the end of the playoffs.",1.0

Applauding this fraud is unacceptable, we really shot ourselves in the knee with Drummond and then hang ourselves from the testicles with the Westbrook trade.

Stop applauding Westbrook for the bare minimun in a SUPER STAR contract. He ain't a make a wish kid.

Is not like he has a good attitude either, if the team wins without him we hear reports from him having a negative behavior, yeah fuck all that.",1.0

38,2023-01-24 20:43:02,10kfo68,Let‚Äôs have a discussion: How is the future cap spikes going to effect the Lakers‚Äô trade deadline moves? Should it?,chasinjason13,"In all the great discussions about the trade deadline and what the Lakers should/might do, I haven‚Äôt heard anyone in this sub talk about the impact of future cap spikes on some of these deals.

Quick Example: Guys like GTJ, Rui, etc., guys who will need to be resigned next year if we trade for them is actually a GOOD thing. 

If we traded for a guy like GTJ and he wants to re-sign at $20mil a year, we need to remember that the cap s expected to be $10mil more next year and almost $40mil HIGHER in 2024. 

Right now $20mil is 16% of the salary cap but in two years it will only be 12% and will, depending on the player, look like an absolute steal. 

I started thinking about this this off-season when people were talking about RJ Barrett maybe being in a trade for someone somewhere. Instead, the Knicks re-signed him and although that number is high right now, if he turns into an all start it won‚Äôt just be a decent deal, it will be a great one.

This is also one of the things that keeps bringing me back to Zach Lavine. He‚Äôs as big a long-term risk as AD in terms of throwing away future seasons because of injury but if he‚Äôs healthy he will be an absolute STEAL at that salary in a few years.

So what do you all think and does this/is this changing your trade opinions at all? Or adding to it?
