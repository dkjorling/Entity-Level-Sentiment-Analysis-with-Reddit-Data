6,2022-11-15 03:27:19,yvlisf,We‚Äôre 13 games in. My thoughts so far.,Smoovekriminal1999,"I knew it would be rough but not 3-10 rough. Lebron looks bad right now but I‚Äôm not worried about him tbh. Nunn has been abysmal, and I think he needs to go I‚Äôve seen enough there‚Äôs no redemption for him he‚Äôs gone scoreless on multiple occasions. Damian Jones needs to go. JTA needs to go, and Pat Bev needs reduced minutes (I think Christie should take his minutes tbh). Lonnie Walker and TBJ have been very solid for us, especially Lonnie. Russ looks solid off the bench, AD looks really good, and we‚Äôre getting Dennis and TB back Friday. I think there still has to be some trades done for sure. Another big, and a solid 3&amp;D wing would be nice. The Indiana trade is ok, but with Russ doing a solid job off the bench that gives the lakers another reason to not trade him, plus I would prefer to see Nunn and Damian Jones traded but what will that bring us in return? I don‚Äôt like the Spurs trade for McDermott and Richardson at all. What do y‚Äôall think so far and what would y‚Äôall want to see happen?",1.0
7,2022-11-15 02:34:27,yvke9i,After going back and looking at the replay of some of the games this season I think this team can be a competitive deep playoff team without a major trade if a few things go their way.,blacPanther55,"1. AD needs to be the clear number 1 option on offense. Ham has to convince Lebron to defer to AD when he's on the court.
2. Lebron needs to get back to his normal 23-25 PER All-NBA  team level performance that he's been since he's been a Lakers. 
3. Russ has to continue flourishing as the 6th man. 
4. Thomas Bryant has to be a playable center that can set screens, box out and battle for boards and be decent on defense. Thomas Bryant is an above average offensive center that can space the floor. If he can do that while doing the dirty work and being decent on defense he unlocks Anthony Davis being able to play the 4. 
5. Schroder has to good enough to take all of Nunn's minutes. 

&amp;#x200B;

If everyone remains relatively healthy and everything else falls into place this could be a really good team.",1.0

10,2022-11-15 01:43:33,yvj979,Would you trade Anthony Davis for the #1 overall pick next year?,LaDolphin,"Anthony Marshon Davis Jr. (born March 11, 1993) is an American professional basketball player for the Los Angeles Lakers of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He plays the power forward and center positions. Davis is an eight-time NBA All-Star and has been named to four All-NBA First Teams and four NBA All-Defensive Teams. In his first season with the Lakers, he won an NBA championship in 2020. In 2021, he was named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team.[1]

Davis played one season of college basketball for the University of Kentucky, when he was first team All-American and the Consensus National Player of the Year. He also won the USBWA National Freshman of the Year, NABC Defensive Player of the Year and the Pete Newell Big Man Award. Davis led the NCAA in blocks and set Southeastern Conference and NCAA Division I freshman single-season blocked shots records. He led Kentucky to a national championship and was named the most outstanding player of the 2012 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament.

Davis left college for the NBA after one season and was drafted as the first overall pick in the 2012 NBA draft by the New Orleans Pelicans, known then as the New Orleans Hornets, and was selected that summer to play in the 2012 Olympics. After his rookie season, he was named to the NBA All-Rookie First Team. The next season, he became an All-Star for the first time and led the NBA in blocked shots per game. He has since become the youngest player to score at least 59 points in an NBA game. In 2017, he was named the recipient of the NBA All-Star Game MVP Award after setting an All-Star Game scoring record of 52 points. Davis was traded to the Lakers in 2019. He has won gold medals with the United States national team on their 2012 Olympic team and 2014 World Cup team, making him the first player in basketball history to win an NCAA title, NBA title, Olympic Gold Medal, and FIBA World Cup. üßõ
