So am I missing something here? Maybe I don‚Äôt understand the call?",1.0

Obviously, we were fucked with injuries at the start of the season.

Nash got hurt in Game 2 of the season, Dwight not healthy enough, Pau missed weeks IIRC with plantar fasciitis and Kobe just killed and willed the team by himself. 

I remember we were 17-25 at one point in Memphis and I think they had a team meeting or players only meeting after that. We finished 28-12 after that. It was a good turning point, but a little bit too late.

I just hope we had some of the bench guys (YOUTH!!!!!!!) from 2013-2014 to that cursed season. Farmar, Xavier Henry, Wes Johnson would have been solid bench players IF WE had them the year we had Dwight. 

We had no bench presence that year. I think Jamison was the only solid one and he was washed that time. Chris Duhon was soooooo trash. 

I honestly believe we could have beaten Miami that year.",1.0

[Five man lineup data vs Warriors \(3\/6\)](https://preview.redd.it/mjx8i93w47ma1.png?width=908&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=c91efe9af6416a7f736ac584aedead8e2385f0b9)

Some things I noticed:

Darvin Ham did something very interesting this game, subbing out Dennis for Reaves early in the first, letting Reaves run point guard with the rest of the starters. That lineup was excellent (+14).

Ham ran Schroder with the bench group instead, which struggled (-9). 

Also ironic that our three(four if you count brown he's only 6 6) guard lineup was actually positive on the night lol (+5). 

&amp;#x200B;

Some more thoughts on Austin Reaves:

I recently wrote about how frustrated I was with Ham playing Reaves as the primary ball handler, expressing that he is a shooting guard. The very next game, Ham plays Reaves as the point guard with the starters and the offense looked really good lol. Instead, Dennis ran with the bench group and struggled. 

This is something I noted when I analyzed the +/- data of all players throughout the last 6 games, as Austin Reaves had the lowest +/- of any Lakers player. I said then that I thought this stat did not reflect Reaves' play, as he spent most of his minutes with the less talented bench group, and therefore had lower +/- numbers. Dennis, on the other hand, ran with the bench group this game and saw a hit to his +/-. 

I still think Reaves struggles defensively as a point guard, getting cooked by Curry while Dennis was on the bench. I preferred when he guarded Klay, as we saw the last time we played the Warriors. 

In conclusion, I underestimated Reaves playmaking ability, but I think he still has defensive struggles against quicker guards.",1.0

18,2023-03-06 22:37:00,11kgip2,Who can we realistically keep next season?,NonSpicySamosa,"I'm really liking this team we have right now. Next season we have LeBron, AD, Vanderbilt, Bamba, Beasley (Team Option), Reed, and Christie.

I'd like to keep Reaves, Beasley, Schroeder, Troy Brown, and Wenyen. 

Not much needs to be said about Reaves. He's becoming a great offensive asset and is definitely getting paid next season. I love Wenyen's hustle every game. Troy Brown is a great role player and pops off on 3's every once in a while. Schroeder's great too. But I'm sure he will also get a big raise next season. Beasley's a killer 3 pt shooter and has a 15 mill team option. Correct me if I'm wrong. I'm on the fence with Hachimura. I wouldn't be too sad if we don't re-sign him for another defensive player. So far D'lo has been looking great the few games he's played but he's probably looking for a lot of money next season. As for Lonnie, I think we can let him walk.

So, what do you think? With some of these players who might expect more money, who do you think we'd be able to keep?",1.0

AD with a monster game to beat the Warriors and move to a tie for the 10th seed and the last play in spot. Special shoutout to Troy Brown Jr and Vando in this game as well. Job's not finished tho, tomorrow is a new day and a new game, go beat Memphis and lets celebrate Pau's jersey retirement. 

2-3 on the rooting guide last night( you could call it 3-2 if you want) so not the best results wise. Portland and Clippers somehow escaping with wins, the Jazz Thunder game was 50-50 so we take either way, gladly the Suns beat the Mavericks and the Celtics lose again.

Want to shoutout  u/deftspyder for posting the results in the thread as they come in.

Here is who you should be giving energy today.

 **Rooting Guide.** 

1. Pistons(+6.5) OVER the Trailblazers.
2. Kings(-5.5) OVER the Pelicans.

If the Pelicans lose the Lakers go into the 10th seed actually. Great win yesterday, get your rest today and we go again tomorrow.
