The ideal route for a team like ours, is to go for a two-way wing that‚Äôll contribute right away. My targets have been guys like Kris Murray, Rayan Rupert, Taylor Hendricks.

So, to any of you who has insight of on the upcoming draft class,assuming we pick somewhere within 15-20, who are some ideal targets that you‚Äôll could see falling to us?

TBJ still hitting big 3s for the Lakers but has cooled of a little bit in recent games. He still played good defense as him and Vando take turns in defending wings. 

Schr√∂der has been a starting calliber back up pg for the lakers, has been clutch in the 4th and always hustles and plays hard on defense. Almost every time he starts he turns up. His chemistry within this team has been great even in his first stint while having good relationship with Ham. 

Both of them likely to get paid next offseason who would you re-sign?? 

Max Christie has played good early in the season. Shoot well from 3, plays good defense while being extremely young. Can he be the back up wing if Rob decided to bring back Dennis or should they let Austin Reeves be the back up pg next year and resign TBJ instead?",1.0
