Winning last night would‚Äôve gone so much closer to nearly secured a playin/off spot. Maybe even too 6. One fuvking point . Two huge AD mistakes ( especially the foul bug one ). Guys shooting 25% AGAIN5-20 after rockets no shoes shooting costing that game. Missing so many free throws . It‚Äôs sad 5-17 dko in last three games .

Obviously we already know what happened last night with AD committing a boneheaded foul on Kleber. Do what Stu says and contest to Kleber's right, away from his body and towards his shooting hand. Or just go full Luke Kornet. This is basic stuff.

But the org/FO has this issue too. Pelinka has made some really great trades but this FO just does really headscratching stuff nobody else would do. Not signing a big when you know Bamba is out and AD is going to sit as planned against Houston...why take an unnecessary risk? Why not go the safe route that has basically zero downsides? Even with the great trade deadline, Pelinka still deserves blame for not making the moves earlier. Now, maybe a trade for Dlo/Beasley/Vando didn't materialize until right then, but once again we basically sacrifice another season or leave ourselves with zero margin of error to save the season. And we know that with Lebron out this team does not have the bball IQ to not have a margin of error. 

And ofc, there's the Caruso disaster. I don't think anybody in the league expected us to NOT resign him, including Caruso himself. Yet we take a gamble on THT instead of going the safe route that would've paid off more with Caruso. We seem to think we are outsmarting people by not making these obvious, easy decisions but instead we only outsmart ourselves.",1.0

39,2023-03-18 14:33:40,11uq29s,The Fanbase,-Phoebus-,"Okay, today‚Äôs loss was devastating and its repercussions are severe, no doubt about that. It was heartbreaking to lose a winnable game at the last moment. 

But the reaction to this unforeseen loss in this sub was horrendous. I know the past cannot be a justification for the actions of the present, but to treat your star players in such a way is what makes this fanbase insufferable. 

I know the Lakers is a storied franchise with tons of legends playing under its banner, and the fans have high expectations from it. Hell, they've won 17 championships. Excellence in performance is expected from its players. 

However its no secret that the years after 2010, especially after Kobe's retirement were mediocre. We suffered the largest playoff drought in our history, with our respect going down every single year. Those were some dark times. However in 2020, we saw a beacon of hope. Our first championship in a decade, restoring the former glory of this historical franchise. This was led by Lebron and AD. We were finally pulled from the slumps and entered the highly competitive race again. 

I do not intend to defend AD's performance today. He did make mistakes and should be held accountable, no doubt. But to send death threats, to humiliate him to such an extent and to blame him for his injuries is simply unnacceptable, by human standards. At the end of the day, it's a game, where people either win or lose. Sometimes the luck favours the other side even though we desperately desire it and that's completely fine. Mistakes were made and we lost, get over it.

I love this fanbase when we win. I have not been a very seasoned follower of this franchise but have been following it for sometime now, especially this subreddit. And I love the passion and zeal with which we celebrate our players, not only the star ones but also the role players, giving them their flowers for an instrumental performance. However, when we lose, we act out and turn into the worst fanbase of the league, criticisng the very players who delivered us the tough fought wins earlier. AD had to deactivate his social media accounts, due to the negativity pouring in. He has been under constant pressure to perform extremely well and he has delivered most of the times, but we are fucking with his mental state. Same goes with the other players.Yes, he may be a super max player or is getting alot of money for playing here, but does that excuse us to be crast? An athlete does not have an MVP-esque performance every single game. They have their off days too. Even MJ had his own off days, so AD messing it up once is okay I guess.

Again, I am not a very seasoned follower of this franchise, or maybe it's not my place to say all this, But after today, this is what I felt and I thought I should share it. I love the Lakers and it's rich history, ranging from Mikan, West from the early 50s and 60s to Magic, Shaq, Kobe and Bron. But if we continue this culture, we'll make this franchise an anti-star one, where no one wants to come due to the high pressure. That's what I believe and its completely fine if some of you disagree.

Would be great if some of y'all shared your views as well!

Cheers! Onto the next game!",1.0

I liked this duo alot especially for replacement of Vando when he is struggling to guard centers. Vando's specialty is wing defender, so no using vando if opponent is attacking the paint. Also they are getting so many offensive rebounds from Gabriel too.

Players did not meet the expectation. Reaves as usual, been our momentum changer today but still missed unnecessary amount of free throws. DLo was chucking some wild threes when we were up, and Beasley did not make one three. AD, who should win the LVP for last game, made terrible defensive mistakes, missing freethrows to cover up his mistake and failed to guard Klebar at the end.

I dont like Ham as our coach but at least he showed improvement and actually did well on changing the lineup in 4th quarter.",1.0

I wasn‚Äôt really a fan of getting Dlo. I just don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs consistent enough and he makes some low iq plays like the pull up 3 today late in the game when we were up. 

I think when LeBron gets back, at least Dlo and Dennis won‚Äôt be asked to do too much. Dennis is another guy I‚Äôm not a huge fan of. He had a good game today but also just not consistent enough. 

I‚Äôm overall happy with the team despite the loss. We missed too many free throws. I guess it‚Äôs more likely now we will be fighting for a playoff spot in the play in games. But if we are fully healthy, I back our team to come out. 

I just think the Lakers should sign Kyrie next season. With LeBron and AD, Reaves, Vando, Gabriel, Troy, Rui, that is a championship team,",1.0

30 minutes to myself to cry, cuss and post shit on Reddit and rant... 

And the whole time I waited for you to respond. (My dad) 

And now, I'm calm for the most part, yet still steaming internally, stressed, aged, but tempered, knowing the season isn't over, hanging onto a thread of hope that we even make the playoffs. 

But in reality, we aren't winning shit this year. We can't even make it to 40 wins before 20 losses. This front office is the definition of incompetence. One good move to 3 bad ones. 

Dlo is good but not the answer. 

I'm closer and closer to accepting the reality that we wasted another year of LeBrons career. 

The reports earlier this week were that we were completely uninterested in chasing Kyrie this off season now that we have Dlo... 

Im of the opinion that that is a huge mistake and that if we don't sign Kyrie this off-season, Lebron's Lakers tenure will officially be a stain on his legacy. 2020 Title or not. Im giving Jeanie and Rob till next season to put a winning team around Lebron to truly compete, from the start of the season. No 2/10 start. I want 40 wins before 20 losses or her bitch ass needs to sell the team or let her younger brother take over. At least he can scout players and draft really well.
