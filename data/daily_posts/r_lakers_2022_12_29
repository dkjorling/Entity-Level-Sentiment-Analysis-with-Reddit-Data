First Lebron CAN‚ÄôT be traded until the off-season. So stop spamming #FreeBron it‚Äôs cringe, do you think Lakers fans want to be in this position. 

We aren‚Äôt trading the 27‚Äô , 29‚Äô picks. You guys won‚Äôt be here when it‚Äôs that time. Even if we don‚Äôt get a Lebron or an AD it‚Äôs the hope that gives games meaning. Even with Zo, BI, Randle we wasn‚Äôt good but young players are exciting. 

The Lakers have been good before Lebron and will be good again after Lebron. Stop trying to gaslight us like we haven‚Äôt got 18 Rings. WE ARE THE NBA. 

So suck it up, you‚Äôll be out of here in the off-season, enjoy Lebron breaking the points record.",1.0

11,2022-12-29 23:11:20,zyjnwn,Convince me why we shouldn't trade AD at the deadline,Inevitable_Night_933,"IF the team continues to play this poorly it is obvious LeBron will be asking for a trade this off-season.  And if that happens it's obvious AD is on the way out too.

We will have more leverage (not a lot but still more) at the deadline rather than in the offseason when AD does actually demand the trade.

What are we doing? We need to make a decision one way or the other, either go all in now or tank completely. This ""no man's land"" thing is just going to lead to LeBron and AD getting angrier and angrier. And we are SCREWED if LeBron breaks the record then decides to sit out the rest of the year before demanding out.",1.0

16,2022-12-29 20:41:30,zyftpf,The narrative that the Lakers will attract stars is odd.,clamscasinoooooo,"Since 1996, the Lakers have only signed two stars off FA.

Shaq and LeBron.

LeBron came to a young LA squad because he accomplished everything he wanted as a player and LA is a great place for his family to be. Also largely in part due to Magic literally showing up at his door step and recruiting.

As a side point, AD is here because of LeBron.

I seem some fans with an attitude of stars will always flock to LA and we will be fine after the LeBron and AD era.

The state of California has teams that are run far better than this current Lakers organization.

Why wouldn‚Äôt stars go there? 

They notice how dysfunctional this organization is. They may meet with the Lakers or mention them for leverage and to apply pressure, but in the end they usually go elsewhere. 

If this team wants to go back to image of being the team that cares to compete, change has to start at the top.

Otherwise - the Lakers may just become the new Kings.",1.0

24-25: 
              Jaylen Brown
              Pascal Siakam
              Dejounte Murray
              Domantas Sabonis

              Lauri Markkanen

Ideally, we‚Äôd love for our current duo and team to succeed with another championship, keep AD after LeBron retires and pair him with one of these guys. 
If shit hits the fan though, these guys are our only real options to re-building a contender, unless we strike gold in the draft or trade our stars for other pieces.
Also I noticed that there aren‚Äôt many great options at the center position, which boosts Myles Turner‚Äôs value for the next 2-3 years.",1.0

Rob Pelinka surely isn‚Äôt exempt from blame, but most don‚Äôt recognize his role. He‚Äôs a figurehead for the team. A puppet on a stick that truly has no power of his own. If there‚Äôs anyone that deserves blame, it‚Äôs Jeanie Buss. She‚Äôs the key to it all. There‚Äôs a reason why she was primarily the head of the businesses financial situation in the past before she came into power. She doesn‚Äôt know crap about basketball, yet she wants to control that aspect of the team. Not only that, but she only wants to keep things within the family. If you want success with a team, you have to branch out to other resources. When Dr. Buss was still in control, he had Jerry West surveying the basketball operations because he actually knew what the hell he was talking about.",1.0

29,2022-12-29 15:12:49,zy7oox,There's more at stake than just LeBron requesting a trade,Granpa0,"LeBron's post game comments are about more than just him requesting a trade this off season.  It's about the franchise's ability to attract free agents going forward.  

LeBron signed an extension based on a very public promise from Pelinka that he would do whatever it takes, including trading future picks, to put together a winning team while LeBron was on the roster.  So far they have done NOTHING!   Actually they've done worse than that.  

Besides the awful Westbrook trade (that no GM worth his salt would have made), they let Caruso (who was willing to take a pay cut to stay) go to avoid paying luxury tax.  They put together a roster that makes no sense in the modern NBA.  A roster full of guards that can't shoot.   They passed on a Heild and Turner trade, two guys that can still contribute.

I hope that seeing what the Suns sold for entices Jeanie to sell.  We need new ownership who can bring in a new GM if we have any chance at salvaging the reputation of the team, because at this point, no one is going to want to come to this d√≠sfunctional mess.",1.0
