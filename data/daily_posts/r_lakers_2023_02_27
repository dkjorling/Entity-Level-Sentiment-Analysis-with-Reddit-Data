0,2023-02-28 07:05:05,11dzltr,Bron should have sat the All-Star Game and rested his foot all week,JamsHDs,"Bron should have sat the All-Star Game and rested his foot all week. 

He sat a couple games before the All-Star week because of his foot and then he played the last game right before the All-Star break. Obviously we knew he was gunna suit up and play so he didn't get judged for sitting games and then playing All-Star Game.

&amp;#x200B;

If he had this serious lingering foot issue he should have sat out those games and the All-Star Week.

30,2023-02-28 01:55:07,11dtnpl,"Too Little, Too Late",PotatoSwag2318,"Injuries are generally unpredictable. But as a team, you can do your best to LIMIT the chances of injuries. I know Anthony Davis is injury-prone, but his foot injury was reported as a stress injury. Stress injuries are generally due to OVERUSE. 

LeBron‚Äôs injury during the Mavs game was an unlucky circumstance, but he has looked hobbled since he broke the record against the Thunder. 

To a degree, injuries are unavoidable. But to not admit that teams can take steps to mitigate said injuries is completely unfair. If any of you would like to say that the Lakers have done everything they could to lighten LeBron and AD‚Äôs load, you‚Äôd be LYING and just carrying water for the FO.

Simply put, had we made the Turner/Hield trade in the off-season, we would have been much less likely to be in this position. By replacing a NEGATIVE in WestBrick with 2 POSITIVES (including a 26 year old who is having a career year) at the start of the season, we would have been able to both decrease Bron‚Äôs minutes and decrease AD‚Äôs wear by having Turner play more 5. 

Converting Westbrook‚Äôs expiring into some better contracts/bird rights going forward via the Utah trade is still a good move. But remember by waiting to do that trade instead of the Pacers trade at the beginning of the season, we took a gamble and saved the 29‚Äô draft pick, but we ran our stars into the ground. That gamble is currently costing us.

Ik its a very obvious take but its true and I feel like it gets swept under the rug a lot. They are the most paid dudes on the team, and have to act like it and winning in the playoffs will rely on them mostly due to the 8 man shortened rotation in the playoffs. 

LeNut has to be LeNut, ADisney gotta be that MF

Yesterday in the Mavs game, Vando messed up his ankle coming down with a rebound but I do not think it's serious. Prayers up for this dude he is outstanding and only 4 mil.

Dlo is also hurt but will come back hopefully by Thunder or T-Wolves game. I would have loved to see him play in that mavs game I feel like we would have been tied at half of within 5-8 points instead of 14 if he's out there.

And again, Bron messed up his foot again with a ""pop"". 

Bro I really hope this is not that serious but my gut is telling me that he will be out at least three games and I do not know how to feel about due to us having not that many games left

WE CANNOT CATCH A BREAK W INJURIES BRO AND IT PISSES ME OFF

WE HAD TWO GAMES WITH THE WHOLE SQUAD FUCKING TWO GAMES AND NOW BRON IS PROLLY OUT WITH DLO.

Look I know injuries are apart of the game, but at this rate? I feel like our team goes through the most amount of injuries compared to all the other teams and you cannot control so Ik should not being this pressed but I am.

Also the types of injuries seem to be total bullshit they all come from the most avoidable ways but they  happen anyways. Like DLO's??? Come on bro that is just bad luck it not even just a simple way to get injured, it just seems like these injuries are always in the worst way possible

But I still feel like after yesterdays win we will have a momentum going forward and we have gained a lot of chemistry which is amazing

I'm telling you the Malik, Vando, and DLO chemistry is just the best to watch and has a very exciting future

This team is exciting and hopefully we get to see a lot of them healthy playing next to one another in the final games but lets have fun with this Mavs win and focus on the Grizz.

If we get that version of LeBron our defense will be historically great. 

I‚Äôm hoping that this defensive slump is just due to his injury, or that he is carrying a larger offensive load since Dlo is out.

72,2023-02-27 14:24:18,11dd280,Our pick this year,psimoestr,"Of course we are trying to make the playoffs and maybe go on a run once we're in there, but have you guys been keeping up with the possible prospects from this year's draft? Assuming we can get to a 7th seed, we would get the 16th pick as thing stand, so we could be looking for some young guns that could really help us in the future, that is if we don't trade the pick.

My pick would be Gradey Dick out of Kansas. Fantastic shooter who can play without the ball. He is not a good defender, but stands at 6'8"", so definitely could evolve to be a competent one.

If you're following, who would you draft around this area?",1.0

Look how tough he made the entry pass eating a bunch of clock, knowing that Dallas wants to exploit the mismatch after the switch.
