Maybe a Tauren Prince or a Kyle Anderson. Slow Mo was a Bruin so theres some connections there and Minnesota loves Pat Bev and could really use his efforts right now if were being honest. That team lacks a dawg and real leadership Bev fit perfect there and helped take them to the playoffs with his leadership and drive. Bev makes 13 mill and Slo-Mo makes 8 mill. I can see Minney doing that kinda deal of the affinity they have for Bev. Tauren Prince makes 7 mill. Either one of those guys would be what this team needs.

This would make sense since he's travelling with the team and not wearing a boot. 

So what I'm saying is that maybe there's hope that this isn't so bad after all... or maybe it's just blind optimism. We'll see.",1.0

As Raptors executives Masai Ujiri and Bobby Webster strolled between the two courts in Mandalay Bay‚Äôs Convention Center, speculation surrounded the long-term future of one of Toronto‚Äôs rotation players.

According to numerous NBA executives who spoke with HoopsHype at the G League Showcase, the top Raptors trade candidate is unanimously Gary Trent Jr.

The current belief from those executives is Trent Jr. will opt out of his $18.8 million player option and enter unrestricted free agency this summer. Two executives told HoopsHype they believe Trent could earn $20 million or more if he entered unrestricted free agency. There‚Äôs skepticism amongst several front offices across the league that Toronto would be willing to retain Trent Jr. if he eclipses the $20 million annual range.

Recently, Trent Jr. was more efficient coming off the bench during a seven-game stretch where he averaged 18.3 points while shooting 49.5 percent from the field and 39.2 percent from downtown for a 117 offensive rating.
