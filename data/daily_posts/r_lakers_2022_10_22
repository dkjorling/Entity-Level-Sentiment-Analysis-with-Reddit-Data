5,2022-10-23 02:54:58,yb66fa,Is it really that hard to imagine russ being an asset defensively?,WhosThis85,"I am by no means a ‚Äòruss apologist‚Äô or anything. I would like to see a good trade happen to get him outta here. BUT, until then i would like to see russ actually help the team in any way possible. 

When we got coach ham and he initially spoke about him wanting russ to be a defensive dog, ppl online actually ridiculed it and said russ has never been a defensive player in his whole career. Although this is true, id like to think throughout his while career up until now, he relied on his extreme athleticism to boost his offensive efforts and didnt feel the need to play defense. 

Even though russ is on the downtrend (to say it lightly), its still plain to see that he still possesses some of his athleticism. Since the start of the season, he has been playing well defensively and in high form this past game against the clippers. Imma go out on a limb here and say he could be doing the opposite to what hes been doing earlier in his career (offensively)  and using his athleticism to play defense instead.   

We are seeing russ‚Äô offense spiral uncontrollably down the toilet and maybe at some point he will recognize it. He may start to concentrate on honing his defense. I know it‚Äôs a long shot seeing how he‚Äôs been speaking in post games and his attitude in general, but I‚Äôm hopelessly optimistic. 

For example, look at lonnie walker, while playing for pop, he was basically a turn style on the defensive end. Him being so damn athletic, and ham pushing the defensive tenacity of the team, hes been playing very well and using his athletic ability to bolster his defense. Hes playing so well now. 

Some may disagree and i understand, but take a step back for a second and think how actual effort combined with athleticism contribute to being a good to excellent defender. If russ actually buys in, he could be a great asset for us while he‚Äôs here and could attract more teams to make offers.",0.37
