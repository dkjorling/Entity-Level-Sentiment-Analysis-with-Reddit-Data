Do you care so little about the perception of the team, perception of the fan base, that winning is literally all that matters?  We should not be giving sexual assualters or domestic abusers a platform by being on our team, we should not reward them and ignore what they‚Äôve done. 

Basketball is just a sport. The Lakers winning won‚Äôt suddenly give your life a new found meaning.

The more minutes he plays the less impact he actually brings. He's not shooting well but i don't think 28 minutes a night is helping the cause either.

Darvin needs to make him a 10 minute per half player to where his shifts are more impactful.

No disrespect but if.Lebron and particularly AD are still the players we think they are at the very least we win 5 out of the next 7. If this team is gonna make up ground this is the best chance they have at doing it.

But why sell it short Suns have our number just like the Clippers and we haven't beaten them since the 2020-21 season. They are banged up but they're beatable. They also know they gave the Blazers game away a few weeks ago so they're coming out for blood on that one.
