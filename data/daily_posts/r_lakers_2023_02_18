10,2023-02-18 20:44:32,115qeki,[Serious Question] LeBron in the 2nd unit?,MonkResponsible7162,"All season long LeBron is playing out of his mind with the starters and the moment he checks out the team tanks.

I was watching the other night and now we have the new trio in the lineup, they seem super confident and self sufficient, also they get AD going. The second unit now you could say is comprised of talented guys who maybe are quiet, or lack confidence.

I was just wondering what would happen if we put Lebron in that unit? The starters come out and play, Lebron gets to rest and then when he comes in he can get the other guys going. Heâ€™d be dominant, maybe playing against some bench players from the other team and he draws so much attention Austin, Rui etc would be open a lot.

Is the answer that if he was on the bench to start, him not being out there would make us way worse and the opponents would be too strong? 

Just curious if anyone thinks that would work. Obviously this would be assuming that itâ€™s Brons idea or heâ€™s cool with it lol",1.0
