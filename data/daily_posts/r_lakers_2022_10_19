In the past you made sure you surrounded him with the best possible players to contend.

I haven't seen much decline but maybe it is a sign that Lebron ain't what he used to be. That or maybe we're stuck with this shitty roster and Lebron can't do anything about it. Its just crazy to think a repeat of last year might happen again.  It just feels like it.",0.35

Been a Laker fan for as long as I can remember as do many in this channel, we‚Äôve gone through the exciting times of Kareem, Magic‚Äòs first game, into the 80‚Äôs, the magic years of purple and gold, seeing riley‚Äôs hair and how we battled the Pistons, Celtics and Bulls.  As we look back and compare our dear Lakers today, it saddens me to see how this franchise is being run with disregard.  What we saw the other day against the Warriors was a disgrace to the memory of Mr. Buss and the millions of fans around the world.  Even Lebron after the game mentioned ‚Äúwe are not a good shooting team‚Äù well why have we not gotten shooters around Lebron?  I could go on and on but wanted to hear our proud community and their thoughts on how we can improve and construct a solid team moving into the season.",0.81

So what the hell are the Lakers doing?

Let's be completely honest here, there's no realistic trade this year, there's no free agent next year, that's going to turn this team around and make us contenders again.  Best-case scenario, and we are an early playoff exit team. 

Our #1 guys is getting older and getting fed up (just watch his post-game conference from opening night).  Lebron has never asked for a trade from any team he's been on, but I wouldn't be shocked if he does this year. 

Our #2 guy is injury-prone and is playing like it.  Still talented sure, but is he really who you're building your team around?  ... and what a team they've built around those two.  A bunch of minimum salary players who play like a bunch of minimum salary players.   Then there's Westbrook... do I really need to get into that?

So what the hell are we doing?  Trading for Buddy Heild, Turner, Poetl, whatever names have come up is not going to make us contenders.  We need to face the reality that the Jazz faced up to, and they were in a much better situation.   Let's trade AD and Bron while they have some value.   We keep Westbrook and let his contract expire and we start clean next season.  It's painful yes, but why prolong the inevitable.  Are we going to wait until AD gets hurt AGAIN and his trade value drops more?  Or are we going to wait until father time finally smacks Lebron in the face or he walks when his current deal is over?

We have to be more pragmatic than that.",0.64

I know he's extremely volatile and has high variance with efficiency, but if we get that from Russ most of the year I'll be pretty happy. This is coming from someone who condemned the trade for him from day one lol. Still don't think we have any title hopes (or maybe even playoff hopes with how deep the west is) without any depth whatsoever, but that was a silver lining I was surprised to take from last nights game.

30,2022-10-19 16:24:24,y8756h,Did I get scammed by VividSeats?,indien,"Sorry in advance as this isn't necessarily Lakers related-- moreso a question about Crypto Arena. I bought tickets to see Clippers-Suns this Sunday and managed to grab a DEAL on courtside seats (I'm a Kawhi fan, and with that much talent on the floor, why not). Bought off Vividseats, received the confirmation email right away but never received actual tickets; they should've popped up in my AXS app. Thought it was strange until I received a following email telling me to call them as immediate action is needed.

The guy on the phone proceeded to tell me the tickets were either ""lost"" or the transaction didn't go through, even though the money was taken from my account and I got a confirmation email for the seats. Funny also because I see the exact same seats I bought on their site for triple the price. Then he says the best he could do is a replacement for the seats of equal value for what I paid (way further) or a full refund + store credit which I don't want. I want the seats I paid for.

My question is: has anyone ever dealt with anything like this? What recourse do I have -- can I escalate it somehow?

Guy on the phone said he was the highest agent and that there was nothing else he could do.

I'm 99% certain the seller of the tickets contacted them to pull the transaction because they listed them too low. Feel pretty ripped off.

If anyone has any advice, please let me know. Thanks.

TDLR; Don't trust vividseats/AXS. Will ""lose"" your tickets after purchase and offer you shittier seats and $5 towards Crypto's overpriced merch in exchange.

Let me know as well if this is violating any rules.
