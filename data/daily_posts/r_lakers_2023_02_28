- with healthy DLO and AD we should still be able to get 8th seed, if we can’t then we weren’t going to get far in playoffs even with lebron 

- While being 7th seed (assuming we beat the 7th seed in play in) means extra play in game, it also means matchup with Grizz, who are probably the weakest of the eventual top 6.

- our new and younger guys get to grow a bit more than they would have otherwise, which will help playoff time",0.71

Of all the games remaining, this was against the team with the best record, plus it was away from home. The team even said they want to go 16 and 6, so obviously one of those losses would probably be from tonight.

No, LeBron, no DLO, and they outplayed the Grizzlies in the first half… Not afraid of them at all in the postseason.

As a bonus, the Mavericks lost against a team they should have beat, one of their easier games remaining. OKC just lost. The Jazz just lost against a team who hasn’t won in a month. We were projected to lose this game, those teams were not. We just have to make sure to win the games against teams that we are close to and we’ll be fine.

17,2023-03-01 03:06:42,11esh7m,Problems ham needs to address if we hope to make a push in the playoffs.,IamSludR,"Ham has 3 major problems that I see more consistent than anything during the year

1. Constant starting lineup changes
2. Plays guys playing bad too long
3. Sitting guys too long/not playing them

The last two are the worst ones of them all but let’s start with the starting lineups. Ham has been changing them too much and there isn’t a lot of chemistry being built with the lineups, we start offensively bad and take longer to get going. However when he plays Dennis and Troy Brown as much as he did and sees the lack of effort and forcing too much and getting turnovers (Dennis had 6 of the 26), that’s hurting us. He didn’t even play Bamba, and played our bad defensive guards on a guard dominant team. Dennis and Lonnie are not playmakers, Reaves is the best substitute for DLO and Lebron that we have. 

This game he put Gabriel out there and we couldn’t get a board since AD and Vanderbilt were on the bench. Why is he not playing bamba at the 5 and Gabriel at the 4? Especially since Gabriel has not played that much but against a potential title contender you trust him at center more than Bamba (the effort is there but we need size)?

 We got back into the game with our gritty lineup (AD, Vando, Reaves, Beasley, Lonnie) but Ham did not like that apparently. As much as Max Christie is young and inexperienced he is our best perimeter defender besides Vando and maybe Reaves, as well as being a better shooter than Dennis and Lonnie. He needs to play even a little bit in order to see if he’s capable (which I believe he is but Ham doesn’t give him a chance). 

Ham has got to start doing better with understanding some guys are playing better and deserve more minutes in a game, and some guys can’t fit a position they simply can’t play (Wenyen at center).",0.81

Steph hurt himself during April I believe and Warriors were in dangerous spot to clinch the homecourt advantage. However, JP and Klay stepped up with other guys and clinched 3rd seed and even made steph to come out of the bench

I am not saying that we are in their situation since their team already clinched the playoff spot back then but what I am saying is that we can do this too

We got the depth, for forward we got Vando/Rui/Reaves(Possibly)/Gabriel(another possible option) for guards we got DLo as a starter and Dennis as a bench and center we got our best guy AD and Mo Bamba and Gabriel

When AD averages 28/10 and occasionally drop 30-40, than defensively we got dennis, reaves, Vando and AD lineup.

75,2023-02-28 11:28:24,11e3qr1,GAMES PLAYED IN THE LAST 5 SEASONS,ThunderClown101,"LeBron James - 270 games played - 54 games per season on average (66% of games)

In his first 15 seasons before joining the Lakers he averaged 76 games per season (92% of games)

Anthony Davis - 231 total games played - 46 games per season on average (56% of games)

In his first 7 seasons before joining the Lakers he averaged 67 games per season (81% of games)

This is the answer to all the Lakers struggles in the LeBron-AD era.   
 

In the last 5 seasons both Lakers superstars have dropped their season average of games played by 20+ games (LeBron went from 76 to 54 games played per season, AD went from 67 to 46).  
 

The shutdown of the league in 2020 was a true miracle for the Lakers. Both LeBron and Davis have not been able to stay on the court and the only time they have gotten themselves a long break during the season, they were able to win a championship.   
 

However this not solely a Lakers’ issue. This has been a trend for many superstars in the last 5 seasons:  
 

Stephen Curry - 239 games played, 48 games per season, 58%.  
 

Kevin Durant - 207 games played, 41 games per season, 50%.

Kawhi Leonard - 205 games played, 41 games per season, 50%. 

Paul George - 256 games played, 51 games per season, 62%. 

When it comes to Davis, Kawhi and George it’s fair to say that they are just injury-prone players, because the all have been in the 27-32 age span in the last 5 years,  
 

Meanwhile LeBron, Durant and Curry - three greatest players of the last decade have been in the 30-35 age span in the last 5 years, so their injury history can be attributed to age and milage, because all of them have been to many NBA finals in the last decade.  
 

This is still amazing that LeBron James while being the oldest of the group and having played more basketball than anyone in history is still averaging more games per season (66%) than Curry, Leonard, Durant, George and Davis.

It is also notable that LeBron and Curry have both been able to squeeze in a championship in that timespan, given that both players play around 50 games per season. Both the Lakers and the Warriors have taken turns missing the playoffs, but winning the title when they got there once.

Who knows, maybe Kevin Durant or Kawhi Leonard are the next in line to squeeze in a title, while missing 50% of games in a 5 year span.   
 

This makes the most sense given that LeBron James, Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant and Kawhi Leonard are undeniably the 4 greatest players of the past decade.   
 

P.S. 

I am not including Giannis on this list, because he is on the upward trajectory of his carrer - the same spot that LeBron was in 2012 or Curry was in 2016. He will most likely end up being the greatest player of the current decade.",1.0
