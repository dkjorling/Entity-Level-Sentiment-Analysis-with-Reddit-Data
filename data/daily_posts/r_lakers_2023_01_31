Schroeder and Beverly is a good defensive backcourt, but I‚Äôd like to see Lonnie out there. Lonnie should start at SG.

I'm gonna talk about this season because we can agree last season he was bad. 


Having a good 5-10 game stretch doesnt justify having another 5-10 bad games afterwards. He's had more really bad games than good and thats not good enough for our supposed 3rd scoring option. People keep saying that we'll miss his playmaking but I dont think that's entirely true. I think dennis and austin reeves can carry that load but maybe a bit worse. Either way russ's playing making on this team is canceled out by his bad shooting percentage and timely turnovers. 


Russ this season is averaging 15.8/6.3/7.5 and 3.6 TOV on 41.6%. FG, 28.9% 3PT, 66.4% FT which comes out to 49.5% TS. That's like 6% off league avg for PGs. 

People are also saying that we need to include a 1st round pick to just get rid of him and thats why a trade isnt being made but what I think is holding back a trade is the lakers looking for that big eye catching trade for him. This doesnt need to be the case. Russ is on an expiring deal and there is only 30 games left in the season. By now alot of teams have figured out if they tanking or contending so it would be easier for them to make trades and clear salaries. The FO wants to trade for a player like myles turner or GTJ which would cost at least a 1st roumd pick. I'm all for these trades to make the team better but if the FO doesnt think so, at least trade russ to get salaries to work with next offseason (which might cost a 2nd). Not trading russ and having him expire with no chance of resigning him, we'll be at a situation we had last offseason where we are basically signing vet minimums. Its also better for russ to be traded so that he can get his numbers up and get a good contract in the offseason cause his numbers right now wont net him as much as he thinks he deserves.

Also i'm tired of people keep complaining about him every single game even if its his fault. I'm more concerned with our wonderful coach and his 6 ft lineups he keep putting out and his terrible missed timeouts he doesnt call.",1.0
