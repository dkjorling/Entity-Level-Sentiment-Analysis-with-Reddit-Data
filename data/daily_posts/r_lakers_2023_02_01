I am a lakers die hard so therefore I am pulling for him and looking forward to the moment.  I see a lot of people predicting he will break the record with a sky hook or tomahawk dunk, ETC‚Ä¶again, not trying to be a hater but I think those last 2-3 points will be the hardest of his career. No one wants to be the guy he scores on to break the record so I see him having to earn it at the line and given he has a history of struggling at the line to close a game, I think the moment will be tremendous. Maybe I‚Äôm wrong but I can see those last couple points taking a minute. Anyone feel the same or do you think he blazes right threw it?",1.0

Am I taking crazy pills? (I think this miiiight not be enough, and anymore and I‚Äôm not sure lakers should do it)

Raptors get value for exp GT, move FVV for expiring Westbrook to open up some cap and focus on growing with Barnes OG and siakam as the vet with two extra FRP and 2nds?

We get expiring GT and 1.5 years of FVV. I think it gets us a shooting wing and FVV handles scoring load with most of his mins on 2nd unit, a few with starters if he gels (Denny to 2nd unit)

Raptors get:
Unprotected 2025 1st
Unprotected 2027 1st
Two 2nds (not sure what we have but something?) 
Westbrook 


Lakers get:
FVV

30,2023-02-01 20:04:09,10r4j6s,LeBron is pacing himself to break the record against the Bucks.,Kanajeji,"LeBron usually struggles after a game off. But yesterday he seemed a bit more laid back than usual. He was looking to pass way more often and only had 24 points by the end of regulation. If he intends to play our next four games, he'll break the record against OKC with his current averages. But if averages about 25 points, he will break the record in a Laker jersey,  at home and against Kareems other team. I fully expect him to take on this facilitator role for the next few games leading up to him breaking the record and hopefully we don't need him to exert himself scoring to win which I'm sure is the most important thing to him. With AD and Lonnie back, Rui getting into his stride and other guys contributing as well, we have enough offensive options to keep us afloat.",1.0
