The urgency just doesn't seem there like in the past. Maybe Lebron doesn't have that luxury anymore because of age or the Lakers are just stuck with this shit situation.",0.67

The truth of the matter is that with AD and Lebron the strategy is to allocate max money across a few role players that provide complementary skill sets.

People will defend the FO for winning in 2020 but they accidentally assembled that roster, with the initial goal being to hunt for Kawhi. They then reverted to their out dated strategies with the Westbrook deal and here we are.

Had they made the Indiana deal prior to the season, our outlook would be dramatically different. But they didn‚Äôt and they won‚Äôt. FO‚Äôs around the league must have crazy group chats - imagine you gave Lebron and AD to any other FO?

71,2022-10-30 11:12:52,yhbr36,Could Rob Pelinka‚Äôs trouble getting quality role players stem from his dislike throughout league front offices,PresidentClash,"Even before we traded for Westbrook, something about the lakers signings seemed off!!

There are several arguments here: 


1) It‚Äôs we‚Äôll documented that Pelinka is disliked within front office circles and that likely leads to other front offices to not work with him or try to rip him off


2) Pelinka is disliked by several sports agencies. The only sports agency that works with Pelinka regularly is Klutch Sports and even they don‚Äôt do Pelinka any favors. Rich Paul uses Pelinka to get his guys contracts (ex. Massive overpay for THT). Rumors are that CAA has blacklisted Rob Pelinka

- this years roster has 6 Klutch Clients, last years team had more than that 


Lakers fans should be worried about the Lakers future. Once Lebron leaves or retires, Klutch may also abandon Pelinka!!


The real reason Pelinka should  be fired is bc of his horrible reputation


HEADS up: I looked at Klutch Sports Clients List and they barley have any 3-pt shooters signed. All the good 3-pt shooters or centers are represented by different agencies (Excel, CAA, ect‚Ä¶)",0.74
