164,2023-04-11 15:08:52,12imsuj,This Day In Lakers History,xxDankerstein,"Hey Lakers fans! Today marks a special day in Lakers history, as we look back at the debut of Andre Ingram, who made his first appearance for the purple and gold on April 10, 2018.

For those who don't know, Ingram was a 32-year-old rookie at the time, who had spent 10 seasons playing in the NBA G League. He was a standout player for the South Bay Lakers, and after a series of injuries hit the Lakers' roster, the team decided to give Ingram a shot.

And boy, did he make the most of it. In his debut game against the Houston Rockets, Ingram scored 19 points on 6-of-8 shooting, including 4-of-5 from beyond the arc. He also grabbed 3 rebounds and dished out 1 assist in 29 minutes of play.

But it wasn't just the numbers that impressed fans and teammates alike. It was Ingram's attitude and work ethic that stood out. He had spent years grinding in the G League, waiting for his chance to prove himself at the highest level. And when that chance finally came, he didn't disappoint.

Ingram's performance earned him a standing ovation from the Staples Center crowd, as well as praise from his teammates and coaches. Lakers coach Luke Walton called him a ""phenomenal human being,"" and said that he had ""earned every bit of the right to be here.""

Ingram would go on to play one more game for the Lakers that season, scoring 5 points in a loss to the Clippers. He then signed a two-way contract with the Lakers for the following season, and played in 4 games for the team before being waived in March 2019.

But even though his time with the Lakers was brief, Ingram's story is one that will always be remembered by Lakers fans. He showed us all that hard work and perseverance can pay off, even when the odds seem stacked against you. And for that, we are forever grateful.",1.0
