11,2023-02-12 22:26:08,110s4k9,Schroeder and DLo,BlueRaj,"Last year the Wolves were one of the best defenses in the league when they paired Patrick Beverley and DLo. Why? Because DLo is too slow to be a point of attack defender on fast guards. Beverley filled that role. DLo is also big and long enough to guard 2s much better than 1s. Schroeder on the other hand is very fast and picks up opposing ball-handlers over the entire court. When the starters were announced before yesterday’s game, I was appalled by Ham starting both of these guys. Thinking it over, it makes a bit more sense now. DLo is more of a combo guard that can control the offense if he needs to. Schroeder is the same to a lesser degree. Neither are true PGs next to Lebron but can fill that role.

Schroeder’s best season had him as the 6th man on the Thunder. That year the Thunder had one of the best closing line-ups statistically. That lineup had CP3-Schroeder-SGA. 3 ball handlers who could create. I hate the idea of a 3-guard lineup (especially small ones), but luckily we have Lebron James. So a 2 guard pairing with Schroeder-DLo next to Lebron can emulate what made that Thunder lineup so successful, while being much bigger.

Now I still probably prefer like Reaves next to DLo instead, but his own natural position is PG anyways, so him being the PG off the bench still works. Obviously things are very flexible. If the Schroeder-DLo pairing starts to look awful like people originally thought, then absolutely stop it. If one of them is cold, close with someone else, we have options now. But I actually don’t mind this pairing for now. Given these specific players, we’ve seen them be most successful in situations most similar to this.

16,2023-02-12 21:02:21,110q73m,Russell Westbrick is a great guy people,RlP-Juice_wrld-999," 

Russell Westbrook loved basketball more than anything else in the world. From a young age, he dreamed of becoming a professional basketball player and making it to the big leagues.

As he grew up, Westbrook dedicated himself to the sport, spending hours practicing and working on his skills. Despite his best efforts, however, he never seemed to be as good as some of the other players on his team.

Westbrook often felt inadequate and frustrated with his performance on the court. No matter how hard he tried, he always seemed to fall short. He began to wonder if he would ever be good enough to achieve his dreams.

One day, after a particularly disappointing game, Westbrook sat alone in the locker room, feeling dejected. He couldn't shake off the feeling of being bad at basketball, no matter how hard he tried.

As he pondered his inadequacy, he saw a TV report about the water crisis in Africa. The images of the children struggling to find clean water moved him deeply. Suddenly, his personal problems felt trivial.

Westbrook knew he wanted to help. He had the resources, and he knew he could make a difference. He decided to donate a significant amount of his earnings, an incredible 50 million dollars, to water charities in Africa.

As Westbrook made the donation, he felt a weight lifted off his shoulders. He realized that basketball wasn't everything, and that he could use his skills and resources to help others. He started to feel proud of himself, not for his basketball abilities, but for the difference he could make in the world.

The announcement of Westbrook's donation caused a media frenzy, and many people reached out to congratulate him. But Westbrook remained humble. He didn't want to draw attention to himself; he just wanted to help those in need.

As the news of his donation spread, Westbrook began to receive letters and messages from people across the world, thanking him for his generosity. The outpouring of support and gratitude was overwhelming, and Westbrook felt proud of the impact he was making.

Despite the positive response, however, Westbrook still felt a twinge of self-doubt. He wondered if he was doing enough, if there was more he could be doing to make a difference in the world.

To address his doubts, Westbrook decided to visit Africa and see the impact of his donation firsthand. He traveled to several countries, meeting with local communities and organizations to learn more about the water crisis.

As he saw the struggle and hardship that so many people faced, Westbrook realized that he could use his platform and resources to make a difference. He committed himself to working even harder, to using his skills and talents to help others.

Westbrook returned from his trip to Africa with a renewed sense of purpose. He knew that he wanted to continue to make a difference in the world, to use his resources to help those in need.

Over the next few years, Westbrook continued to work with water charities and organizations to make a difference in the world. He traveled to various countries, meeting with local communities and leaders, and learning more about the issues that affected them.

As he worked to make a difference, Westbrook found that he was growing as a person as well. He was no longer defined solely by his basketball skills, but by his dedication to making the world a better place.

Despite the many challenges he faced, Westbrook remained committed to his cause. He knew that he could make a difference in the world, and that he had a responsibility to use his resources to help others.

As he continued his philanthropic efforts, Westbrook realized that he had found his true calling in life. He was no longer just a basketball player, but a humanitarian, a leader, and a role model.

Westbrook's dedication to making a difference inspired countless others, both on and off the court. His generosity and commitment to philanthropy earned him the admiration and respect of people around the world.

As Westbrook's influence grew, he began to use his platform to raise awareness about a variety of social issues. He worked with other athletes and celebrities to advocate for causes like education, healthcare, and social justice.

Through his efforts, Westbrook became a powerful force for good in the world. He inspired people everywhere to use their skills and resources to make a difference, and he proved that anyone, regardless of their background or circumstances, could have a positive impact on the world.

Over time, Westbrook's legacy grew beyond his athletic accomplishments. He was remembered not only for his skills on the court but also for his generosity, his compassion, and his unwavering commitment to making a difference in the world.

Years later, long after Westbrook had retired from basketball, people would still talk about the impact he had made, the lives he had touched, and the change he had brought about in the world.

And though he had once felt inadequate and frustrated by his basketball skills, Westbrook knew that his true calling had been to use his resources to help others. In the end, it was his philanthropy, not his basketball, that defined him as a person and made him a true legend in the eyes of the world.",1.0

33,2023-02-12 16:42:24,110k0pt,How to use Vando,3nnui,"We all love Vando and we should. Many of us would like to see him start, but Rui might be the better fit in the starting line up for spacing. Plus Rui has been putting out great effort on both ends, even if he doesn't have the same speed/instincts at the defensive end. Having Vando waiting on the bench will be a strong motivator for Rui to play with intensity. 

Vando should be our wing stopper, he has the speed, the length, the footwork and fundementals to put an opposing wing in hell. Guys like KD, Luka, Kawhi are in for a long night. He will wear them down and make them miserable. If he gets in foul trouble, we still have Rui to take the assignment. If both get in foul trouble, then you can put Bamba in and move AD or Bron to that troublesome big wing. Big wings are in for some long days against the Lakers.",1.0

 - AD got mid range shots at will (they didn't fall but I'll take those looks all day).

- Dennis got to the rim/FT line at will and had space a mediocre three point shooter needs to make his own.

- Our other mediocre three point shooters looked WAY more comfortable as well.  Rui, Reaves, LW4 all shot more confidently.

- The sense of doom our team has when the other team hits a three and we know that we have no chance of matching it with our own was GONE.

That Poole run to start the game would've broken our spirit any other game this season, the confidence to know that we could get it back (and that a backbreaking Russ TO wasn't coming) was so damn refreshing.",1.0

It truly felt like that 2020 and even 2021 teams that had that nice flow and mix of players. Everyone seems more comfortable in their roles and are playing their game while contributing to the overall team success, but again only a 2 game sample size. I’m not a Westbrook hater, but the fit just never made sense and I think that contributed to a lot of guys having to adjust and be uncomfortable, but now everyone just looks way more confident.

42,2023-02-12 09:27:09,110bpat,Here is our rotation for rest of season,Nonameheroz,"We have so many options, but here is what we should go with.

Starting.

DLo
Rui
Lebron
AD 
Mo Bamba (since AD doesn’t want to play center all the time)

Good defense, good shooting, and good size

Our dedicated sixth man should be Reaves, the dude just have energy and can flat out play.
I like Reaves better than Schröder. But it is most likely we will play Schroder as sixth man unless we start him, which would be so dumb.

So second units: 
Schröder
Reaves
Vanderbilt
Beasley
T-Brown

Loonies might get very little minutes. Since the roster is so stacked.

Limit Lebron and AD minutes, if we are blowing out teams until playoff.

But the closing lineup:

DLO or Reaves depend on who is hot
Lebron 
Rui
Vanderbilt 
AD

Lock down defensive squad, with so much shooting and offense.

This team could win it all if healthy.

Though our record really suck that we have to basically treat every game like must win.

Hopefully with so much bodies, we can pull it off.
This squad is even way better than our championship team at full potential.",1.0
