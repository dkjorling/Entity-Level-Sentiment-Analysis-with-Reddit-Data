0,2022-12-20 06:52:49,zqh8uk,Can someone explain the ‚Äúhard cap‚Äù if we resign Russell Westbrook to say 12-15 million per year (1-2) years in the offseason? Still confused,willsteves,"So the offseason ‚Ä¶

Maybe we keep important pierces somewhere around, I‚Äôd like to see Austin Reaves (Arenas rule) stay around 7-10 mil per. Walker with the NTPMLE at around 10 mil (hopefully ü§û), maybe TB at 5 mil hopefully and maybe TBJ at just above the vet min.

Maybe we trade for Luz or Bogdan.

Then how do we resign Russ to come off the bench at maybe 10-15 mil? Can we just go all over the cap? How does the previous cap and salary work together?",0.52
1,2022-12-20 06:34:09,zqgvss,The perplexing case of AD‚Äôs injury,suhar97,"I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm not the only one whose on the edge of going to bed and just circling back to what in the world is going on with AD‚Äôs injury? 

It‚Äôs hard to find any closure‚Ä¶when we don‚Äôt actually know what‚Äôs happening.

On the one hand - every report since Sunday has painted this bleak, mysterious, and eery situation where Davis will miss extended time beyond the initial 1 month estimation. I‚Äôve read comments here and on r/nba suggesting that he may be done for the year.

Now on the other hand, what we do know is what our eyes have shown us. AD gets injured but plays through the half of the nuggets game. He scored on multiple occasions and, if my memory serves, I believe he even had a dunk at some pt following the injury. Contrast this with the 1) MCL sprain against Minnesota (where McDaniels falls into him) where we feared AD tore something and the estimate there was at least four weeks AND 2) falling on Goberts foot causing the foot sprain where the estimate was also around 4 weeks and he immediately needed help getting off the court. Not to mention, he was on the bench for the wizards game with no boot and no noticeable limp and apparently on the bench for the Phoenix game (I saved myself the pain and didn‚Äôt watch so i can‚Äôt comment on if he had a limp).

I really have no clue what to make of this. The optimist within me says that none of the reporters have a clue because we literally don‚Äôt know, but the pessimist within me says this is taking too long so it has to be awful.


Edit: also adding, it‚Äôs odd that nothing regarding AD came up during the postgame today with Darvin? Don‚Äôt wanna think too much either way on this but that should be noted",0.84
