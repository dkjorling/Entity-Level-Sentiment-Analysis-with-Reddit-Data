44,2023-04-12 17:10:38,12jsr7k,Bamba Starting?,LordWeaseltown,"So I've long since given up on Mo Bamba seeing any significant play this season, but when we got him, my first thoughts were ""wow, we could do 2020 again, but even better!

Imagine a starting lineup of LeBron, D'Lo, Vando, AD, and Bamba. Compared to the 2020 lineup of LeBron, Avery Bradley, KCP, AD, JaVale

This lineup would be even longer, with far better spacing, and there would be a secondary creator on the court so PG LeBron could get help with facilitation. Vando, while not a floor spacer at all, is certainly moreso than JaVale, and Bamba's shooting means AD would have a much more open paint than he did starting at the 4 in 2020.

On defense, D'Lo wouldn't be under as much pressure and could be more physical with all that length on the back end, he does have solid length for a guard. Vando could take whichever SG/SF is more of an offensive threat. I feel like the 2020 Lakers and the last few years' Bucks have shown that having that much length on the back end makes perimeter defense so much easier

Plus it would save AD the wear and tear from playing the 5 and let him do what he did in 2020: terrorize attackers from the weak side.

What are your thoughts about a lineup like that?  I know this game is pace and space now, but the the Lakers won a championship with this formula before and I think there's still merit to just being bigger, longer, and more athletic than the other team",1.0

48,2023-04-12 15:50:56,12jqe25,I really want Austin Reaves to start off the bench and put Beasley as a starter,junahn,"Now Im not saying that because AR didnt play last night. But Beasley at the starting lineup is better. Although Austin reaves is better defender, playmaker(not even a comparison), and decision maker, he needs to take a role as a knock down shooter if it comes to playoffs. Which he is not and he is always hesitant to shoot threes under playoff level defense. And considering his physicality and his speed he struggles to score like he used to in regular season because the call is much more tougher in the playoffs.

Reason why I want Beasley as a starting lineup is first, he can score in the playoffs and can get hot from three even in playoff atmosphere. He can draw attention and he has athleticism to drive to the paint also. We also have some sample size where we destroyed good teams by large margin by putting Beasley as a starter with a full lineup(against NOP, GSW twice). If Malik struggles, we can put AR early to the lineup.

What Im saying is that AR is better as a bench leader with Dennis and that makes us one of the best bench production team in the league right now. Also Beasley is our valuable sharpshooter and whether he makes a three or not, he can be contributor of drawing defense or creating space for Lebron to drive and AD to be at the paint.",1.0

52,2023-04-12 15:02:44,12joyb7,Lebron is the problem right now,NotSoSurePlatypus,Probably going to get flamed for this but it needs to be said. Since returning from injury lebron has been the lakers worst rotation player. He was -14 last night bringing his +/- to a whopping 0 over the last five games. Our offense becomes stagnate when he’s on the floor and it’d be a stretch to say he’s an active defender. I still think he can positively affect the game in transition and as the roll man but I believe he needs to take a more  back seat role for the lakers to make noise in the playoffs.,1.0

The crowd was HYPED. Despite awesome shooting until the 4th, Wolves ate shit when it mattered most. Going to really enjoy the Memphis series and excited that LA made it in after this crazy season. 

That said I am a devotee of Lord Westbrook and must remind everyone of what he gave y’all this year:

- He played 52 games on the season for LAL before the deadline while Lebron has played 56, AD 57. Play-in excluded. 

- He logged 1491 minutes in those games, 6th total on the team. 

- Russ ended the season still leading the Lakers in assist per game and in total assists with 391 over those 52 games.

- He remains 3rd in total steals for the Lakers, 5th in total points (just 3 and 6 behind Schröder and Reaves), 3rd in total rebounds, and 5th in total blocks. 

Think what you want about being a net positive but he showed up as much as anybody and you weren’t getting that contribution without him pre-trade. Give my guy a ring if LAL wins it all.",1.0
66,2023-04-12 13:26:17,12jm88k,Last night game was the reason why Rui can be our X-factor for our playoff run.,junahn,"With his aggressiveness and able to perform physical defense, he can be our scorer besides Lebron and AD. His three point shots tend to fall down, and his mid range jumpshots is very effective when it comes to post season. Tonight he scored 12 points but with some big buckets down the stretch and some great interior defense against KAT and Kyle Anderson. 

I hope Darvin can use Rui more than Vando. Although Vando is hell of a defender unless he knocks down some open threes he is liability of offense. Rui being our physical defender/transition offense/scorer can be huge for post season",1.0
