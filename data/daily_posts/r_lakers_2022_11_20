We're 29th in the league in points given up in the 3rd at 30.7 only Minnesota is worse at 31.8 but they're 20th in points scored per 3rd themselves so it's not as detrimental.

Every game the themes are the 1st 5 and final 2 minutes of the 3rd quarter. We're either up at the half and the team erases that deficit within minutes like the Cavs game. We're tied at the half and the opposing team pushes the lead to 8-10 points within minutes like the Clippers game the other day.

The same problem for the past 2 seasons my only conclusions are AD and LeBron loses focus to start the 2nd half and are just coming out flat and the defensive edge isn't there. We're not coming out of the half and establishing AD off the bat like we do to start games.",0.91
