I know we have been in need of a big man so I‚Äôm hoping TB stepping up helps take the pressure off AD when he gets back..

Minnesota: Russel Westbrook + Picks

Ive said it before, Russel Westbrook is still a great passer and he pushes the tempo really well where the Lakers succeed. If we trading Russ, we need another passer making Bron a scorer. Rumors has it that DLo is on the trading block. Trading for him will fill the PG duties while also adding shooting to the team. Also this is his last year, resigning him for 20-25 mil  would be a steal while having money to extend contracts of TB and Reeves. Dream scenario would be adding DLo and Bogdanovic to this team. Dont know how but that would be the best deal for me.",1.0

But last two games have looked totally different. Against Memphis - drew up ATO for a key alley oop and played the foul game to perfection. Against Portland he benched Russ in favor of Bev‚Äôs defense and took key timeouts when we built good leads.

All you can ask for is he keeps learning and improving.",1.0
13,2023-01-23 04:36:18,10j3wlf,"PLEASE, NO THREE GUARDS LINEUPS EVER",SgameB,"We play like a top-seeded team when we don't have 3 guards on the floor. FO needs to trade a couple of guards to bring in some shooting and wing depth. Hoping for a trade near the deadline when the asking prices finally come back to earth. It can be a big Russ trade or a marginal trade around the edges however Bev and Nunn have not been completely ass lately so if we get a good Russ trade let's make that move.

AND WE AIN'T NO FRONTRUNNERS AND FIGHT HARD TILL THE END. LOVED THIS GAME",1.0

I get wanting so hard to hope for something but this team eats ass at a county fair and its fucking embarrassing that anyone would delude themselves into believing we are worth more than donkey shit in a Mason jar destined for a play in loss. 

Bring AD back we still suck at threes and have holes on defense. Make a trade for shooters we are still not a deep as any of the top teams in the west. And we have one of the worst coaches in the league who decides rotations like droopy dog after a blunt

Making it to round 1 should be our reach goal. But the ""make a trade and were good"" shit is fucking clown town",1.0
