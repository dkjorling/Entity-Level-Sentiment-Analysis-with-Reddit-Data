2,2023-01-30 05:02:18,10otboi,What fixes can Ham make right now?,icykkuno,"The referees and our front office are completely out of his control. It‚Äôs possible that a trade isn‚Äôt even made before the deadline, and we‚Äôre stuck with this current roster until the end of the season.

However, Ham does have control in putting us in positions to win the game. At the very least, we should be playing optimally rather than hurting ourselves given our seeding.

A list of things Ham can fix right now:

1. No 3 guard lineups - Easiest fix he can make without disrupting anything. There is no reason Bev, Dennis, and Russ should be on the floor together given our personnel.

2. Bring Max/Wenyen back - Our best effort players should absolutely not be out of the rotation. These guys bring length, athleticism, rebounding, defending, and hustle no matter what.

3. Frontload Russ minutes - We know Ham will never bench this guy for extended periods. But Russ actively hurts the team on both sides of the floor when he‚Äôs out there. Play Russ 20-25 minutes without any minutes in the 4th. Ham has done this a few times but needs to be more consistent.

4. Play the hot hand - If Lonnie or TB are cooking, play them more. We have role players that won‚Äôt be consistent night in and night out. It should be intuitive to Ham to keep playing the ones that are in the groove. 

What other quick fixes would you make?",1.0

I know this seems dramatic as all teams deal with shitty calls, but it feels especially bad for the lakers this season. And again it‚Äôs not just because of last nights game against the Celtics, but that felt like the straw that broke the camels back.

Lakers are clearly a much better team than their record shows and we‚Äôve competed with the best teams in the league but it truly feels rigged at this point.

With these additions, regardless of our c~~oach~~ cock sucking receding hairline dog, we will 100% close out 4th quarters, leading or not. These pieces are perfect for all our problems.

**How they will solve our porblem:**

 4th quarter chocking, no problem, they are the most clutch editions that will ever arrive to our team

Shooting (everyone will get lots of practice making uncontested 10ft shots with no defenders) and that will also help our free-throw shoting (more pratice).

Not to mention the massive length of their egos will solve our lack of height and rebunding without AD!!!!

Finally, our spacing will be god tier becase they stand so far away from the ball they can't see or hear what is going on !!!!!

LeBron is consistently in the top 5 paint shots attempted and since 2020 has really fallen of a cliff on drawing calls. Embiid, Giannis who are way less skilled and coordinated than LeBron consistently get rewarded for throwing their bodies into other players. 

Now - it‚Äôs very obvious LeBron has made an enemy of many Republicans and that goes above basketball.

29,2023-01-29 20:30:50,10ohpeu,[Opinion] No one should rely on calls to win close games. Are the Lakers as mad about their own mistakes as they are about the no call on a single play?,_mattyjoe,"2 points is 2 points, right?

The no call occurred on a 2 point play. LeBron should have been at the line shooting 2 free throws to potentially win the game. There's no debating that.

However, think back on all the mistakes the Lakers made throughout the game which cost them multiple 2 point opportunities. The turnovers, the bad possessions, the poor shot selection, the lack of effort, even the bad clock management in OT.

We have seen a pattern throughout this season with this team not being able to finish close games against great teams. They often fail to execute in crucial moments. We all know this, we've all seen it. Complaining about a no call at the end of the game is a red herring. It's a way for the Lakers, even LeBron, to let themselves off the hook for their lack of execution.

Any great player or coach would tell you that if you're living or dying by a single call or no call by the refs, then you HAVEN'T WON THE GAME. You haven't done enough. This can happen at any time, regular season or playoffs. Great teams, great players, DO NOT RELY on foul calls to win games. They assume that they will NOT get any calls, and then ensure that they execute solidly enough to win the game anyway.

Hell, the Lakers STILL had a chance to win the game. They had another OT period in which they were, once again, not able to execute. Worthy and others said the team seemed to have the wind knocked out of it after the no call. Why? What's more important to you, winning the game, or whining about the no call? You're gonna spite yourself out of a win just because you're pissed at the refs or the league?

That's not championship basketball. That's not mental toughness. That's not how any of the greats would approach the game. You play to win. You execute. If you still have a chance to win, even under the most harrowing of circumstances, you don't let up until the clock says zero.

The Lakers should be more upset about their inability to execute down the stretch in close games than they ever are about a call. If they're not, then they're not tough enough to live up to their potential.",1.0

When the NBA partnered with gambling apps for a share of their revenue, they should have outsourced their reffing to an organization not tied to gambling.

Since the NBA makes more money when gamblers lose more money. This sets up a situation where the league has the incentive to fix games. The Lakers have the largest fan base. Someone posted that 90 percent of the money line bets were on the Lakers last night. This was one of the premier games in the league and I expect there was heavy action. It literally meant that the league made millions of dollars in extra revenue when the ref ""missed' the call on Lebron last night.

Given that this is the 4th or 5th time this season that the Lakers have ""lost"" on a last second call, it's hard to think this is random.

I will never know for sure why the ref missed that call. Incompetence, Celtic fan, league direction, it really doesn't matter. What does matter is it looks bad and undermines the product. Silver is a lawyer, he knows this shit. Yet the NBA refs stay in house. It's time to change that.",1.0

\- Averaging 188pg and 45% from three on 9 attempts a game (only Tatum, Simons, Klay, Lillard shoot more 3s a game)

\- Offensive raptor of +2.0 and defensive raptor of -0.7

\- Russell westbrook has a defensive raptor of -2.6. Lonnie has a defensive raptor of -1.8 (and an even worse offensive raptor of -2.6 for some reason). 

\- His defense isn't anything to die for but he has multiple games of 2 or more steals and even had a game with 4 steals and 3 blocks a few days ago.   


**Myles Turner in 2023**

\- He's an elite floor stretching center that is also a rim protector, a rare specimen: ""Turner is one of three players with at least 50 3-pointers and 75 blocks this season -- along with Memphis' Jaren Jackson Jr. and Milwaukee's Brook Lopez""

\- He is averaging 18 ppg and 39% from three on 4 attempts a game 

\- Most importantly he's averaging 2.4 blocks a game

&amp;#x200B;

**What we Can do Moving Forward**

\- It is clear we need a shooter, a big man, and utilize westbrook to get some solid role players back (we will have to attach picks of course)

\- A three team deal with the raptors which gets us Poetl and GTJ 

\- A deal with Hornets that gets us Rozier/Plumlee and a filler (not as desirable but I like Plumlee this season)

\- A deal with Orlando which gets us Gary Harris/Mo Bamba. Bamba is shooting 39% from three on around 3 attempts a game and 1 block per game. Gary Harris is less of a true shooter, and I'm not too excited about him although he's shooting a career high % from three this year.

They genuinely think their team did absolutely nothing wrong and that they deserved that win. They‚Äôve even said Jayson‚Äôs hit on Lebron was a foul but minimum at best. Even worse, they‚Äôre claiming that Lebron has always had the whistle on his side and that yesterday ‚Äúhe finally got told no and couldn‚Äôt handle it.‚Äù 

I would like to think that all people are rational, but when people love something they can be blind to a fault. We ALL saw what happened yesterday and I find it hard to believe that Boston fans are genuine trying to excuse the 19FT difference.",1.0

This would help teams who suffer blatantly bad calls all game. If this rule was implemented, we‚Äôd still have 2 challenges when LeBron gets fouled and then execute a challenge with the foul being called and LeBron likely icing the game with FT‚Äôs.",1.0

Refs were awful obviously, but my god we have $47 of dead weight lugging around the court sabotaging us with bricks, turnovers, and me-first basketball. There are at least 9-10 games this season where instead if we have a decent big and a spot up 3 pt shooter INSTEAD of westbrook in minutes, we win the game either bc of poor ref calls in close games OR bad Westbrook plays. 

We have about.. 2 week or so till the deadline? Have to do it. HAVE TO.",1.0
70,2023-01-29 08:31:31,10o2xk4,Do the Lakers have a case to overturn the Celtics loss?,doulikegamesltlman,"I was wondering if Jeanie Buss and Rob Pelinka should submit a case to Adam Silver's office to overturn or negate the loss for the Celtics game.

If the Lakers submit a case of the missed foul call at the end of the game, along with evidence on Eric Lewis's potential bias towards the Celtics, could the Lakers argue for a no decision, negating the loss?  And is the potential image of the Lakers looking like a crybaby worth challenging to rule the game a no contest?

Also, can the Lakers request that officiating crew for the Lakers/Celtics game not be allowed to officiate any of their games in the future?

Or is it better for the Lakers to just move on from all this?",1.0
