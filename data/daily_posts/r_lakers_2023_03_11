---|---|----|----
D'Angelo Russsssel | 2.5 | 5.5 | 45.5%

Troy Brown Jr | 1.9 | 4.3 | 44.2%
Malik Beasley | 2.8 | 7.8 | 35.9%

- Reaves has been great from beyond the arc. He doesn't really take pull up shots or off the dribble but when he is open he has been hitting them.

- I'm especially pleased with TBJ he takes good quality shots and provides good defense. He is the wing we all been clamoring for and I really hope he keeps this up and we re-sign him. He is only 23!!

- I understand why Beasley has been mediocre for us. We been asking him to take tough shots. But I'm also disappointed how we don't look to run some plays as we have a Klay caliber player. I'm hoping with Dlo and Lebron can find him when he is open.",1.0

Hey when bron gets back and we in the playoffs, I don‚Äôt see LAKESHOW being defeated by anyone . They will win . Imagine going against the suns first üî• DLo vs Book , Ad vs Kd , Lebron vs Chris Paul. If that happens no one will stop kd and no one will stop Davis , so that‚Äôs even overall. But lakers in 6 or 7. If they face the clippers . Lebron vs Ad and DLo vs Pg . They really don‚Äôt got anyone stopping Davis. Either way Jarred Vanderbilt/ Rui is gonna shut down kawhi and PG. they will lock them down . And Russ is gonna be left wide open ! Clippers is easy series . Even with healthy PG and Kawhi they still getting lockdown ! Other team like Grizzles, Nuggets , and kings would be easy game for the lakers . Except warriors , since they are playing poorly due to injuries I don‚Äôt see them winning . If lakers go to the finals, it either gonna be Celtics or Bucks. If it‚Äôs Celtics , I have lakers winning in 6 . We have seen how bigger wings can contest Tatum and since we are first in defense, we have a chance to shut down Tatum . By switching jarred and Rui on Tatum . We can also put Troy,jarred and Rui on brown. On the other hand if this was the buck in the finals it would be a close one. 50/50 both sides. If healthy and aggressive ad is playing then they might get a shot. The bench , DLo and bron must all play good defensively and offensively shooting the basketball. End of analysis!

Lakers take care of business at home vs the Raptors for the first time in forever. D‚ÄôLo, Dennis, Austin , Rui and Vando all with incredible games.

We won a game where AD had 8 (EIGHT!!!) points on 7 shots, and we looked good doing it. 8-3 since the trade deadline and the team chemistry vibes are immaculate.

To add to that a 2-0 record on the rooting guide with not 1 but 2 double digits comeback wins. The 76ers beat the Trailblazers with an Embiid game winner and the Nets beat the Timberwolves in OT.

Lakers now 1 game behind the #6 seed with momentum. Job‚Äôs not finished tho and here is who we root for today on a 4 game slate

**Rooting guide.**

1. **Knicks(+5.5)** over the Clippers
2. **Hornets(-2.5)** over the Jazz
3. **Grizzlies(-1.5)** over the Mavericks
4. **Thunder(+2.5)** over the Pelicans

Still on cloud nine from yesterday but today is a new day, get some rest and we go again tomorrow. .500 here we come.

GO LAKERS!!!

53,2023-03-11 14:12:23,11ol6ed,Who Would Win in a Matchup between the 1972 and 1979 Lakers Teams?,MegaVaughn13,"I was having a debate with my friend about which Lakers team was better, the 1972 team that won 69 games and went on to win the NBA championship, or the 1979 team that also won the championship but only had a 47-35 record. We couldn't come to a consensus, and I'm interested in hearing more opinions. It came up because I recently built an NBA Simulator that uses stats to simulate NBA teams playing each other, and the simulator had the 1979 team winning majority of the time.

If you had to choose, which team do you think would win in a head-to-head matchup, and why?

Personally, I believe the 1979 Lakers team would come out on top. While the 1972 team was stacked with talent, including Jerry West, Wilt Chamberlain, and Gail Goodrich, the 1979 team had a more balanced roster and a more modern style of play.

The 1979 Lakers had Magic Johnson, who was a rookie at the time, but already making a huge impact on the game. They also had Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who was still dominant, and a solid supporting cast that included Jamaal Wilkes, Norm Nixon, and Michael Cooper.

Overall, I think the 1979 Lakers would win in a close game due to their more modern style of play and well-rounded roster, in which the simulator I built justifies.

If you're interested in a more in-depth analysis on the simulator outcome, where 1979 Lakers would come out on top, check out the full write up I did (that my friends don't believe is realistic) \[[https://statsurge.substack.com/p/time-traveling-matchup-simulating](https://statsurge.substack.com/p/time-traveling-matchup-simulating)\]

But I'm so happy with our recent wins that I at least want to entertain the question:

Right now, 

6 seed = Memphis or Sacramento round 1, unsure what team round 2

5 seed = Phoenix round 1, likely Denver round 2

Obviously things can shift but that feels pretty likely. IMO 6 seed is an easier route. Never been big on intentionally losing or resting players for positioning and we can match up with anyone. But I would rather have Phoenix and Denver exhaust each other if it plays out that way organically.",1.0

Being that Stu is now 76 years old, I get very sentimental knowing that there will be a large portion of my life where that man isn‚Äôt calling Laker games. He‚Äôs not only objective when he calls games and how he discusses officials‚Äô decisions, but he just adds so much to every telecast.
