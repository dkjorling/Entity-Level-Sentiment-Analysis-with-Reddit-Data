Proceeds to put in Jared Vanderbilt who can't shoot. And Gabriel who can't shoot either. Rui could of easily scored enough points in the minutes Gaberial, Vanderbilt, and Walker had, and won us the game.

Sorry but its what everyone is thinking.

The only other explanation is that if he breaks out they can't keep him for a cheap contract. Which was sort of the reason why the Wizards iced him and traded him. Essentially they are clearly cutting his minutes to cut his contract or harm is career. It's a bad look on the organization. Let him play. Let him do well. And if we can't keep him. At least we tried our best to win this season. But forcing him to sign a cheap contract would be racist. Because clearly Austin Reaves will also demand a higher contract with the way he is playing. Possibly higher than Rui's who is not even given a chance.

Rui averaged 19 points per 36 minutes with the Wizards even while being iced out of the offense. Kyle Kuzma was given a chance even though he wasn't restricted and may walk next season.

So it seems that the Wizard's coach was racist against him too. Wizards and Lakers might not make the playoffs this season because of their racism. Which would be sad.

Wizards would run 3 guard lineups with Rui too. It clearly illogical. The best explanation is a race issue. 

The phrase is called being ""Quietly Fired"". And it usually happens to minorities. He can legit sue the Lakers and the NBA if he fills as if he is being quietly fired for race. They are giving him less minutes to destroy his stats, his career, and his salary extension potential. He should contact his lawyers if that's what it takes to get his minutes. For him. Millions of dollars are on the line. And the Laker's season is also on the line.",1.0

For example (Dennis runs the shot clock down to 8 sec) then throws the ball to AD with only 8 seconds left. Our guards to give AD the ball when he far away from the basket. 2019/2020 and 2020/2021 our guards would feed him the ball when he was at least 12 feet from the basketball not from the three point line and expect him to work from there.

34,2023-03-26 22:29:55,12323n8,Key Takeaways from the Lakers vs Bulls Game:,ILoveMasterYi,"Positives:

\- Lebron James returned and looked like he was moving well and could get to the rim

\- When Lebron was on the floor the offense looked very good, Malik got better looks and he was setting everyone up

\- Lost by only 10 despite being just torched defensively, with some adjustments the game on Wednesday should be much more competitive

\- Our defense was able to keep them under 60 points in the 2nd-Half, almost everything that could have gone right for the Bulls went right and everything that could have gone wrong went wrong for the Lakers at times. 

&amp;#x200B;

Negatives:

\- Rotations: we ran multiple small lineups that forced AD to contest a lot of tough layups and it hurt us when he was in foul trouble

\- Defense: Transition defense was just poor, they had way too many easy looks and straight line dunks coming in the transition. 

\- Quality of Looks: We should been focused on attacking the Bulls paint, especially when Drummond was on the floor and had 3 fouls in the 3rd, instead we settled a lot. 

&amp;#x200B;

These games happen, we have won 3 of our last 4 and every team loses but these mistakes are very fixable and the Lakers will look to get the win on Wednesday. Love the LakeShow and make sure you enjoy the rest of your weekend (its just a game, don't ruin your time &lt;3)",1.0

Darvin Ham said he‚Äôd stick with Austin Reaves in the starting lineup if/when LeBron returns.

 I think we like this. Austin has earned his starting spot and i think the fit with both Bron and AD is great.",1.0

Lakers take on the Chicago Bulls today in another game towards the push for the 6th seed. AD needs to be dominant again and hopefully D'Lo is ready to go. ""Miraculously"" DeRozan is healthy to play for them and you know Pat Bev is going to be hyped up so need the team to come with the needed energy and focus.

A 2-1 day on last night's rooting guide, the Kings take care of business again for us as they've done multiple times this season beating the Jazz and the Pelicans beat the Clippers which on one had moves them tied with us but on the other hand moves the Clippers closer to being within reach for the 6th spot. Lastly the Suns beat the 76ers without Harden.

A 3 game rooting guide today so here it is.

**Rooting Guide.**

1. **Hornets(+10.5)** over the Mavericks
2. **Trail Blazers(+8.5)** over the Thunder
3. **Warriors(-6.5)** over the Timberwolves

None of this is important if the Lakers take a step back today, so take care of business and watch as other things unfold.

GO LAKERS!!!

Keeping the 8 seed is an absolute must.,canadageese444,"Assuming all games are 50/50, a 7/8 seed gives you a 75% chance of making the playoffs while a 9/10 seed only gives you a 25% chance. And once you factor in the homecourt advantages the 7/8 seeds get those percentages probably push closer to 80/20.

There's no point doing all this work just to get knocked out in the play-in. Keeping the 8 seed is a must",1.0
