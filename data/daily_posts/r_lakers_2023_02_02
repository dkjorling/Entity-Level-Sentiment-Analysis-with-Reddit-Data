51,2023-02-02 19:13:54,10ry2df,Flea's open letter to struggling Laker Kwame Brown,ocmaddog," dear kwame,  
 please forgive this fanatical letter  
 but i am a laker fanatic  
 it's an insanity i allow myself  
 

i am writing you this open letter as a fan and a fellow human being.  
 i know that you are a man of reasonable intelligence  
 and a man of considerable emotional depth  
 so i write this letter, leaving none of my thoughts dormant  
 hoping that i can be of some inspiration to you  
 

being a devoutly loyal laker fan  
 i watch nearly every laker game all season long  
 and have done so for several years  
 when i heard word of you coming to the lakers in exchange for caron  
 butler and chucky atkins  
 i was excited and pleased  
 i was gonna miss caron, but understood that the lakers had a stockload  
 of players at his position, his size  
 and needed to correct that imbalance  
 i really saw this move as a great opportunity for you to get a fresh  
 start and show what you were really capable of  
 and bring the lakers up  
 

it must have been weird going from high school straight to the  
 wizards and being yelled at by michael jordan   
 after all, you were just a youngster and learning the professional game  
 and it must have been a whirlwind of strangeness, just making that  
 transition from being a boy to being a man, and having to deal with all  
 that pressure, and having it play out in the public eye  
 i can only try to imagine what it was like  
 god knows it probably would have driven me crazy  
 i would probably have said and done crazy things  
 or even withdrawn and shut down and stopped myself from growing the way  
 i was capable of  
 so anyways, i thought that it would be great for you to get away from  
 d.c. and get a fresh start  
 especially with phil jackson around, whom i perceive as a thoughtful  
 and kind man  
 i compared your situation to jermaine oneal's, who didn't do so great  
 in portland  
 and was there for 4 years just like you in d.c. but then got a fresh  
 start with the pacers and really blossomed  
 

so here we are nearly half way through your first season in los angeles  
 my hometown, on my beloved lakers  
 and you still are not playing close to the way you are capable of  
 playing  
 there are those people in l.a. and around the country who just   
 don't think you are capable of playing at a higher level   
 that this is all you've got  
 and if there are a percentage of people who think that  
 i bet you even think it sometime  
 or even worse, maybe you have fallen into a rut  
 maybe it is depressing to have bad games and you have given up on  
 reaching for that highest part of yourself  
 that part that you get in touch with sometimes when you show flashes of  
 the greatness within you  
 

those people who think that you are not better than you are playing now  
 are wrong  
 if you think it you are wrong  
 you are as great as you want to be  
 you could be one of the great power forwards to play in the nba  
 you can turn it around  
 you are young there is plenty of time  
 you only live this life once  
 and you cannot leave the greatness within you unexpressed  
 it would be a disservice to the universe  
 unless of course you know in your heart that you would rather be doing  
 something else and you are only in the nba for the cash   
 in which case you should go do that other thing  
 because you do only get to live this life once  
 and it is a crying shame when people leave their song unsung  
 but to the pedestrian fan like myself  
 it sure seems like you were born to tear it up on the hoop   
 court  
 

i know that for myself  
 there have been many times in my life when i was so down  
 anxiety ridden and confused  
 that i was not nearly as great at being who i am  
 or feeling the joy and love and opportunity of each day  
 not even reaching in the right direction to get on the righteous path  
 not even capable of trying  
 because i was lost  
 barking up the wrong tree  
 hurting inside  
 

it took me a while to get to it  
 but i found ways to get back to feeling great and doing my best  
 i developed a spiritual practice  
 i went to a therapist and worked on emotional issues  
 that had been messing with me all my life  
 sometimes i would feel so lousy  
 i didn't even know what was bothering me  
 i tried hard to figure it out  
 and i got help from god and from smart people  
 and i let go of years of stuff that was slowing me down  
 i'm far from perfect but i am a lot better and still working on it  
 i am a happy man  
 

now i ask you please not to take offense at this kwame  
 i do not pass judgement  
 but it seems to me that something is troubling you  
 and keeping you from your own greatness  
 and you need to work it out  
 

i see you not try sometimes  
 i see you not go for the rebound sometimes  
 i see you not get back on defense sometimes  
 i see you not help out on defense sometimes  
 

and once in a while i see you block a shot get an awesome rebound and  
 explode to the hoop like a genius and put the ball in the hole with  
 great gusto  
 

i know that you could be great all the time  
 do what it takes to make your mind clear and your heart free  
 therapy  
 meditation  
 whatever you can do to help yourself  
 so you can give your all  
 do it  
 start now  
 

i know you want the respect that comes with being great at what you do  
 

kwame brown could be a hero in this town  
 the x factor that brings the lakers a championship  
 

dont leave your sung unsung  
 

your friend,

63,2023-02-02 13:47:22,10rq7r4,Does anybody else believe we can beat any team in west (except denver) in a 7 game series,utrid_son_of_utrif,"IF we make the playoffs and are fully healthy, i think we can compete with any of the teams with the experience we have except maybe denver. We have been playing and beating the best teams out there and I dont see how we couldnt figure it out in a 7 game series (granted we have to make it there first).

Lets look at the teams in contention. We'll probably be at the bottom half of the playoffs and play a top 4 seed in the west. Ill say denver beats us (although we beat them 2-1 in h2h). Memphis dont seem consistent as last year and their core are still young and inexperienced so ill probably favor the lakers in 7.  

The kings are the 3rd seed and as well as they are playing, can we really not beat them? Sabonis isnt a great rim protector and we get most of our shots from inside the paint. Fox is a future superstar but not there yet. The clippers are 4th right now and honestly im not sure how they are 4th. They've been good lately but kawhi and PG dont sound scary as they used to. PG's taking a back seat to kawhi and kawhi's been slowly getting there and im not sure if he'll be 100% in the playoffs. 

I wont talk about the rest because they're all jammed together but the only team that could give us problems is GSW although their lack of bigs could be good for us. Also, dallas is a one man show and as much as love luka and he'd probably drop 50 on us, I cant see him winning the series on his own against us.",1.0
