5,2022-12-27 00:44:47,zw1xtb,How high is Reaves gonna grow?,junahn," I do think his defense is better than his frame and size, just needs to bulk up to defend against forward will make him very solid defender in this league.

But offensively he has developed so much skills compare to last season.

He has been one of the best to draw fouls, pull up jumpshots, and floaters during crunch time. Nowadays, its not surprising to see him score over 20 points.

His playmaking is also better than poole, clarkson when he was playing as sixth man and Tyler herro.

He is averaging 11 points with 39% from 3 pointer and 52% from the field. Maybe he can be 16-17 points scorer on average next year and probably 19-20 points scorer if he gets more minutes.

Can he be one of those all star caliber players one day? Or do you guys think he is one season wonder",1.0

7,2022-12-26 23:58:57,zw0w4n,"Jay Huff - avg 16ppg, 8rb, 36%+ from 3",Flopdo,"Ham chose not to keep Huff on this roster. I think that was a mistake imho. If he's not going to play Damian (which I don't blame him, that guy is lost of the floor), are you going to tell me we couldn't use Huff in some bench minutes and to spread the floor a bit more?

LBJ is finally saying what I've been saying this entire year... Ham doesn't know how to make second half counter adjustments, and anticipate opponent adjustments. I mean, he's really, really bad in this area, and it's cost the Lakers a lot of W's this year. A sign of a good coach, is how you come out in the second half as a team.

Disclaimer: I wasn't a fan of firing Vogel. Vogel is clearly a good coach, and like ANY coach in the entire NBA, has his weaknesses. But people in here think he was either bad, or average... which is a complete joke, because he's been called by his peers a genius on defense, knows how to get guys to play together, and ran a decent offense by putting the ball in his best playmakers hands and placing guys in the best situations to succeed.

He lost the locker room last year, I think mainly because of WB. But firing him and hiring an even worst HC, wasn't the answer. And yes, of course someone had to take the fall for Rob, but this nightmare needs to end. The Lakers are becoming a joke of a franchise, and it's difficult to sit by and watch it all unfold.",1.0

Jeanie and Rob are going to ignore the mentions and they know the ruckus is there but they aren‚Äôt really going to do anything.

The same two who couldn't build a competitive team around LeBron and Anthony Davis, now rebuilding the team... Do you guys really think that will result in anything good? Unless we have the incredibly amount of luck to get a superstar in one of our next drafts, we will be a bad team for a long time. I doubt any superstar will want to come to the Lakers. I don't know if i'm being too pessimistic, but damn, things aren't looking good for the team",1.0

For whatever reason, AD isn't injured in the game, he's my starting Center. And he is dominating on defense. 4 blocks, 3 contested shots, and 3 rebounds in 3 minutes.

12,2022-12-26 18:12:07,zvszdg,LeBron‚Äôs Extension will save our future,movn,"Look I‚Äôm no basketball GM genius but I can‚Äôt help but think the extension, regardless of how much Pelinka fucked LeBron, is really good for the Lakers. I imagine LeBron wants a trade this off-season of which I wouldn‚Äôt blame him for wanting. However, this would not be possible without the extension and he would‚Äôve walked for free. At the very least we can get some pieces to rebuild in return for delivering LeBron-level revenue to another team that wants to contend. In a league where the fresh crop of great talent (Ja, Trae, Tatum, BI, etc) are coming into their own, we need to make moves to keep up or be lost in the shadows for years while those legacies play out. We might be able to have our cake (the bubble chip) and eat it (a new young crop of talent). With WB‚Äôs contract and AD possibly wanting out, we will have stupid money next year to start a relatively fast rebuild especially with younger talent in shitty markets that are getting impatient with their FO‚Äôs inability to help them win a chip. I just hope the Celtics don‚Äôt win a chip in the process lol.

Feel free to circle jerk your frustration about this season but face it, we ain‚Äôt winning shit. Do we gamble for a chip next season or do we make moves with our remaining big pieces? And before you say people won‚Äôt wanna come to the Lakers because of how we treated LeBron, remind yourself that he was given pretty insane privileges in the construction of the team AND it‚Äôs the Lakers‚Ä¶ in Los Angeles‚Ä¶ just look at how Kuz is still a spokesman even after getting ripped on by the fans and playing in the shadow of LeBron and AD. Banging models and getting wild LA attention will do that.",1.0
