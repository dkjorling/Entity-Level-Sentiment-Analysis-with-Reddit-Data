Nothing against Darvin Ham but just seeing the difference in the teams makes me question if we let a head coach who's won a title with us walk was a bad call. Granted, I guess there wasn't much they could do. The salary was tied up with Westbrook's contract and not like teams were willing to give a whole lot for him.",1.0

Next, holy shit the difference it makes when the leaders on the team step it up. So i just want to note something: everyone said AD played horrible against GSW(Away Game @ Warriors). He had just come back and had a fairly underwhelming first half. 3rd was a little better. However, then hit the final 6 or so minutes in the 4th, and this dude locked in: you could feel he's physically trying to exert himself(both ends of the floor), talking shit to Draymond, getting good looks--a notable shift in intensity. The entirety of the team followed suit. Its like the team helped him hang in there, doing team shit, and this dude comes back and puts them over the edge by himself. He was seriously terrifying the other team. Warriors were on the lookout for this dude at every corner. Divincenzo got him shit moved, Klay got his shit moved. DAMN

This game against the Mavs, it was both LeBron and AD in the second half... you could literally feel through the screen how bad LeBron wanted it, especially in the post(PAUSE)(""aye bruh is this dude 15 or somn)(fuck u oldass)(fuck hes corny)(fuck is he gonna stop now).  Its like he cuts down on excessive movements and gets crazy precise. Now you have a third guy, who keeps that intensity up ALL the time.. energy wise.. this team is seriously, different as fuck,6 man swap aside). It is just so crazy how important leaders like them are. I am genuinely so happy they are teammates. Kobe and LeBron on the same team.. it would be so fun to watch even one season of it. Kobe would have brought that out in him every 4th quarter, Olympics doc hit different. 

Anyway, this is just how good they can be, especially in the playoffs. I cannot wait to see them in the post-season again. Please, heel (hehe). hastily. (alliteration)

Ran the program for our five man lineups against the Mavs, some things I noticed:

Darvin Ham has been good at picking our starting lineup, leading the team at +12.

AD had a monster impact, being a part of the top 6 starting lineups. 

Lebron + the bench struggled tonight, possible due to Walker taking the place of Schroder, as Schroder had to cover for Dlo being out.

&amp;#x200B;

[Data tracking our five man lineups since the Pelicans game \(2\/15\)](https://preview.redd.it/1lb01cts4nka1.png?width=894&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=f60c9d1dd04c8c246fd364e611f51c3eecd564fd)

Darvin Ham has been playing around with quite a lot of lineups. Our strongest lineups seem to comprise of Schroder-Vando-Bron-AD, with either Beasley or Reaves filling that fifth player. This may be skewed against Dlo since he only played one game with the Pelicans and got injured early in the Warriors game. Look forward to seeing how he performs with the team against the Grizzlies. Vando-Bron-AD remain a winning formula.",1.0

His game today was indicative of this.  I don't think he has a team mentality that we need him to have to contribute to our ultimate goal.  Very Dennis 20-21 vibes when he came in acting like an entitled starter.  

He needs to make a case for himself and prove he deserves to be a starter... not that I think he should be with Vando here now.  But he at least strive for it and let this game talk.  I fear he'll sulk.",1.0
