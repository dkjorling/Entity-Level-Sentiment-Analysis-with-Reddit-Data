For whatever reason the media and r/NBA shits on us for trading our ‚Äúyoung core‚Äù for AD when none of the players we traded ended up becoming anything.

- Julius Randle is putting up crap stats with a horrible contract and the Knicks aren‚Äôt going anywhere 

- Lonzo seems like his career might be over. Zero timetable for his return. Could you imagine the fiasco if he was still
with the Lakers

- Ingram is a nice player, but he isn‚Äôt close to the guy that SGA is. The Clippers traded an All-NBA player and like 7 picks for Paul George who shit the bed in the 2020 playoffs and the proceeded to miss a year with injury

On top of all of this, Kawhi seems like he‚Äôll never play 10 straight games ever again. All I‚Äôm gonna say is that things could have been so much worse and we should be grateful for what we‚Äôve gotten as fans. That‚Äôs why I view anything that happens in LeBron‚Äôs tenure as icing on the cake. We already won a championship. If we kept Randle, Ingram, and Lonzo, this team would go nowhere.",1.0

We were the only team in discussion for him, and that smoke lasted long enough there was a time where it felt a deal could've landed.

If, and when this happens, I actually think we'll contend. I'm not denying Kyrie is the biggest muppet in sports, but with Bron they'll be able to do it. The option to move Russ for a big and a shooter (Turner and Hield) and we've created a team with tremendous depth.

There's so many if's in the scenario but the only far-fetched part is Irving not losing his damn mind, something he's done time and time again over the last 6 or so years. The last time he wasn't acknowledged as a complete nut job, he shared a locker room with LeBron.

It's optimistic, but I can't deny the promising thoughts of it all.",1.0
