Now anytime Reaves is mentioned on Reddit or in a game, she jokes that she was his first fan and discovered him. After his career night and talks about him getting paid in his next contract, she joked that she‚Äôd follow him anywhere he goes in the NBA.

I guess this is a pointless story, but I find it really funny that my girlfriend who knows a small amount about basketball made one joke about the lakers new young player who ended up being the crowd favorite and a big part of this Laker roster.

Los Angeles Lakers Sign LeBron James and Anthony Davis to Join Star Player Austin Reaves

Los Angeles, CA - The Los Angeles Lakers have just announced the signing of two of the NBA's most talented players, LeBron James and Anthony Davis, to join their star player Austin Reaves, who just achieved a career-high 35 points in a game.

The signing of James and Davis represents a significant boost to the Lakers' already formidable roster, as they seek to reclaim the NBA championship. James, widely regarded as one of the greatest basketball players of all time, brings with him a wealth of experience and a winning mentality that will undoubtedly inspire his teammates.

Davis, a six-time NBA All-Star and former Defensive Player of the Year, is a dominant force on both ends of the court and will add significant depth to the Lakers' frontcourt.

Joining forces with these two superstar players is Austin Reaves, who has already demonstrated his immense potential with his recent career-high performance. With James and Davis on board, Reaves will have the opportunity to learn from two of the best in the game and further develop his skills.

Speaking about the signing, Lakers General Manager Rob Pelinka said, ""We are thrilled to welcome LeBron and Anthony to the Lakers family, and we know they will be great additions to our team. With Austin already showing his talent, we believe we have a strong foundation to build on as we look to bring another championship to Los Angeles.""

The Lakers' fans will undoubtedly be excited to see this new-look team in action, and the upcoming NBA season promises to be one of the most anticipated in recent memory.
