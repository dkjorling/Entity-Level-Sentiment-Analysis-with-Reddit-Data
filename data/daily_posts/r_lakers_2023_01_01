3,2023-01-02 05:33:06,1014h3z,Should the Lakers blow it up and rebuild? Or retool?,Tg11T,"I ask especially after LeBron in his latest comments saying he wants to play meaningful basketball or that he wants to be competing for titles. Lakers have missed the playoffs in how many years since LeBron has been there? Yeah LBJ won a chip in the Bubble with AD but this current Lakers team as presently constructed are out of the playoffs hell they look like they are in the lottery. And with LeBron, AD and Russ that's unacceptable especially if you're Laker Nation. So I have to wonder should the Lakers blow it all up and full on rebuild by trading all 3 players LeBron, Anthony Davis and Russell Westbrook? You get as many draft picks you can for all 3 players and go completely young? Or do you retool the team by making trades to land better pieces to compliment LeBron to turn this ship around?",1.0
4,2023-01-02 05:21:05,10148vp,"If Lakers Somehow Acquire Buddy Hield and Myles Turner, Lakers is going straight to playoffs; and if you get Lebron and AD to playoffs, Barring any Catastrophic injury, it's over, Lakers are Winning it all Again",BoxRev,"Why so:

1. Buddy Hield is this era's own version of a mixture of Kyle Korver and Ray Allen. He's a true specialist and he's a cold cold man. There's no chance that a Ray Allen or a Kyle Korver will turn into a dud on any team. Lebron will find this man just like the good old days; and he will hit 3's as often, addressing the issue of Lakers shooting woes.

2. Myles Turner is exactly what AD needs right now, with Myles at center, AD can go back to 4 and save AD a little bit from wear and tear until playoffs. A Davis and Turner version of twin towers will augment Lakers team defense a hundred folds, they will seal the rim which will help our guys in the perimeter to defend more efficiently and effectively. In short, we will regain our short comings on the defensive end, it might not be as potent and impenetrable defense of the legendary Lakers 2020 Champs, but it's more than enough to compete even against the upper echelon of the league.

These two is the antidote to turning everything around. Get these two now and we're back on track.",1.0

I've seen some posts around here with people posting season tickets for sale but seems these aren't posted until right before the game. I'd like to get tickets ahead of time just to lock in the game, but do understand that you can get good deals closer to game time.

Aside from that, looking to see the best way to go about getting tickets? and best time to book? I know with Ticketmaster you'll get handled by the fees but unsure of any other way to get tickets really.
