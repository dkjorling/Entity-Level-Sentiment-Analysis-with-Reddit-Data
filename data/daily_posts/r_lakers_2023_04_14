11,2023-04-15 00:21:18,12mje3d,What is your realistic expectations and predictions for this year's playoffs?,YouCannotBeatVince," With the Lakers set to face off against the Grizzlies as the 7th seed in the playoffs, it's important to consider their realistic expectations for success. While fans may have high hopes for the team, it's important to remove any bias and objectively assess their chances. With that in mind, how far do you think the Lakers realistically can go in the playoffs",1.0

23,2023-04-14 17:04:41,12m3zoe,Worried About Vanderbilt Starting,SpaceAndBball,"Wolves made a key adjustment when they put Anderson on AD rather than KAT. They put KAT on Vando and left him wide open, resulting in a double team to AD with no consequence. That forces AD to make a pass out of a double team which he sucks at. And if he somehow passes to a cutting Vando, I don‚Äôt trust Vando given his butter fingers and ability to finish. 

This led to so many turnovers, and we were forced to take Vando out of the game. I fear Grizz would do the same thing with Tillman on AD and JJJ on Vando roaming the paint. 

Any strategies on how coach would counter this? Easy one is replace Vando with Rui, but I would love Vando‚Äôs defence on Bane",1.0

30,2023-04-14 08:21:26,12lpiyv,The Last Couple of (horrible) Years Have Made us Forgotten what a Concrete Championship Team is,BrainEuphoria,"I want to start by saying that I believe the Lakers can make some noise this postseason, but we haven‚Äôt fully account for Lebron‚Äôs aging to see that he needs more help than we realize. He could fare much better by not being overexposed and always missing significant time to injuries if his teammates take more load off of him.

I think we may be too critical of AD. He‚Äôs the only player that when he gives you 21pts and 12 rebounds, it is called a disaster. Expecting 30pts and 20 rebounds every single night is insane. If you need AD to have that kind of Monster game to convincingly win, then maybe his teammates should chip in a little more? High intensity defense exhausts you and fighting for offensive boards or operating in the paint the way he does takes energy. Maybe that exacerbates his glass nature? 

Surround AD and Lebron with bodies that spreads the burden more, so when they take nights off or possessions off, people won‚Äôt call for heads.

Reaves is a forever Laker, but let‚Äôs be real, he‚Äôs not starting on a legit championship level team (Bucks, Celtics, Cavs, Knicks, Clippers, Suns, Warriors‚Ä¶Wolves). We should absolutely keep him and I love what Reaves bring to the table, but his value might be a tad bit inflated as a Laker.

DLo is streaky, injury prone and chokes in the playoffs. I think he‚Äôll fare better this playoffs bc he‚Äôs all we‚Äôve got alongside Shroeder and Reaves. I like him and would much rather keep DLo as a fourth guy or rotation player, which means we need a clear and more reliable third option.

Once AD/Lebron goes to the bench, minions take over. It‚Äôs easy for opponents to feast on that, especially when DLo is injured and Vando non existent on offense.

Vando is athletic and solid defensively. I prefer a decent two-way big. It‚Äôs like 4on5 on offense but I like Vando‚Äôs defensive intensity.

I prefer reliable shooters over streaky Beasley. He‚Äôs useless when his 3 ball isn‚Äôt falling and that‚Äôs not good at all. You‚Äôre one man down in rotation when he has a bad 3pt shooting night and he has more of those than anything else.

Wenyen‚Ä¶.I won‚Äôt even go there. 

Rui and Shroeder are good pieces.

This roster is clearly an upgrade compared to pre-deadline and because our past roster constructions has been so horrendous, we don‚Äôt remember how good a championship team should be.

Overall we should explore strengthening our team and increasing our depth this offseason.",1.0
