0,2022-10-11 06:56:09,y123gj,Almost all our guards are good defenders,halfwolf-halfsloth,"With the exception of WB, every single one our guards is an average or above average defender. PBev, Reaves, Schroeder, Nunn, LW4 all playable defenders. I think we can get away with playing 3 guards with AD and Bron or even JTA/Wenyen because of our defensive versatility. I think we’ll surprise some people. With all this said, that WB trade would make us a really good team.

12,2022-10-10 18:56:15,y0mudt,When can we trade Lonnie Walker?,tall_mf_,"First off, I wanna ask when the time is that you can trade the players you’ve picked up in free agency.

Whenever that time comes, would y’all be willing to trade our mid-level exception being Lonnie Walker for a wing? 

I think that we should as he might legit get left out of the rotation playing behind Russ, Nunn, Pat Bev, Reaves and Shrouder. Therefore I think we should trade him for a wing. And yeah, I know it’s weird trading the mid-level exception, but let’s be honest, it was a bad signing from the first place",0.26

21,2022-10-10 09:16:27,y0a328,Initial thoughts after 4 pre-season games,mxj7,"Let's start with the positives : 
- Team mindset + youth : team is back to running, hustling, focusing on the defensive end, good vibes. That's definitely something I wanted to see after how last season concluded. Props to the new coaching staff and the players for being serious about that.
- AD looking great : The most frustrating part about last year's AD (for me) was that even when he was healthy, his shooting and FT% were way off compared to 2019. So far, seems to be fixed. 
- Westbrook fitting better : His shot selection seems to be improving and his lapses on defense fewer.
- Bron looking like ... Bron : No further comments needed.
- Nunn looking exactly like the player we were hoping we were getting last year. So encouraged by his display !
- Reaves' further improvement 

The not so positives : 
- Most critical, Our frontcourt (including wings) is too light. Obviously I'm not saying anything new here, but I'm realizing it might actually be worse than I initially thought :
* Center-wise :  DJ and TB performances have both been underwhelming. TB doesn't seem ready / fit enough (he's getting no play time with the first unit so far) and DJ's effort on the boards has been meh (esp. on the defensive end).
* Wings-wise : To think that our only ""true"" wings are LBJ - JTA - Troy Brown Jr is ... 
- Lonnie Walker is redundant : I actually liked what he's shown so far, especially since he had less prep time because of his injury. 
But with the level Nunn has been showing, I feel like Westbrook - Nunn - Bev - Reaves is a solid guard rotation already. Otto Porter Jr would have been so great on the current roster for the same price tag.
- What the hell do we do with Schroeder once he's good to go ? DS is even more redundant less needed than Lonnie ... I'm a bit concerned about what his attitude will be if he's not getting any playing time. I know he's been brought with the idea of trading Westbrook in mind, except Westbrook is here so ... ?

Looking forward to the next 2 games. Something I'd particularly like to see is a PatBev(or Nunn) - Lonnie - Reaves/JTA - Bron - AD unit. If Reaves can play solid minutes at the 3, this might be one way to maximize Lonnie's talent.",0.86
