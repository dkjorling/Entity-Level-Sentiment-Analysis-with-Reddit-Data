But if the Lakers signed all the players they wanted to re-sign, Austin Reaves, Malik Beasley, Rui Hachimura and Mo Bamba, could they then theoretically do a sign and trade with D'Lo of another player?

The odds for the pre play-in seeds (7 through out) and first round (post play-in, 4-8) seeds are listed separately. For simplicity, I'll list the odds for the 4-6 seeds, followed by the pre play-in seeds for the Lakers.

4: 0.2%

5: 16.9%

6: 21.2%

7: 24.5%

8: 21.3%

9: 13.6%

10: 1.7%

Out: 0.5%

The single most likely seed is 7. They have a 38.3% percent chance of finishing with the 4, 5, or 6 seed. The seeding odds will probably narrow after each game, especially after the game against the Clippers on Wednesday. The top four seeds in the West (Nuggets, Grizzlies, Kings, and Suns) are almost locked into their spots now.",1.0

In my mind the goal has always been to avoid the play in at all costs. Primarily because an one game setting is too unpredictable.

My question is will fans in this sun be content:

**Play in Tournament.**

In the playin tournament the 7th seed and the 8th seed play themselves to determine to gets the 7th seed and plays the 2nd seed in their side of the play off bracket. The 7th seed plays the game at home.

On the other side the 9th seed plays the 10th seed, the 9th seed plays this game at home.

The winner of this game goes on to play loser of the 7v8 game, with the 7v8 loser playing the game at home. The winner of this game goes on to play the 1 seed in the playoffs on their side of the bracket.

They deep dive into analytics and a bunch of us (40 or so people nightly) watch every game live, while Tim and Tom break down what is happening. The website allows us to sync up together and watch the games together live if you have a Cable/Internet/TV provider and it's always a great time. I just wanna give a shoutout to them because not many teams have this kind of in depth breakdown of the game as it's happening and the community that we have. So give it a shot. I have no investment in this so it's not an advertisement.

If you don't have Twitter, just check in just before tipoff https://www.playback.tv/LakersWatchParty
