1,2022-11-05 06:24:43,ymm5d2,LeBron's lack of defense has continued on this season. The PF needs to have aggressive defense to close-out 3s and take charges. Utah targeted LeBron and scored 20 on him in first half. Also rebounded at will since LeBron did not try to grab boards in 2nd half.,MITWestbrook,"LeBron James needs to stop playing the 4. Let someone else like Troy Brown, Wenyen or Austin Reaves play the 4. Let LeBron just chase around guards.

LeBron cannot play as a big.

The only problems we had were two guys. Lebron and AD ironically. AD disappered defensively and offensively against two white dudes. Lebron was terrible. 
However this loss also happened majorly cuz how crazy jazz was shooting tonight.
They became 2017 warriors against this good defensive team.
Plus they just blew nuggets and other contenders too so lol they are not tanking this year.
Russ was AMAZING. Like I was questioning ab Darvin Ham how he didnt let Russ take game over till the 4th.

Rest of the season he keeps his mouth shut and does not get a significant injury. Plays well and helps the Nets make the playoffs.

Kyrie becomes a FA. He wants Lakers and willing to sign 2/70M with a team option. 

Bron and AD are close with Kai - they endorse 
Phil is too - endorses him
Ham is on board 

Do you sign him???

I say YES but curious to see how the nation feels. Would like to see the responses in a few months.",1.0

Josh Richardson is your textbook 3 and D guy, 6‚Äô5‚Äù, long, and a really solid shooter while also capable inside the arc as well. Poeltl is the perfect big man to complement AD, living in the paint, protecting the rim, and doing all the dirty work. After this trade we‚Äôd be much more well rounded. We relieve congestion in our guard lineup while still improving our shooting, and we get a much needed true center. Am I missing something or is this just a perfect trade for us?",1.0

67,2022-11-04 17:02:34,ym4b11,Which route would you prefer we go?,playmiker,"It's been an interesting start to the year so far. One thing that's clear though, as Trevor Lane keeps saying, this roster is screaming for a trade. All summer long we were begging for a Russ trade. Now we're seeing Benchbrook might be the way to go forward. Regardless, we will need to make a move at some point in order to fully unlock this lineup. The question is, how big of a trade do we do?

1. The big one. Trade Westbrook for any of the available packages that we're all aware of now (Pacers, Hornets, etc).

2. Mid level. Use Pat Bev's contract (and Nunn if you need it) to help solve one of our needs. Potential targets here - Myles Turner or Buddy Hield, Poeltl + Josh Richardson, Jae Crowder.

3. A smaller deal. We can use Nunn's contract plus a minimum (or Damian Jones since he makes a little more than a minimum) to try to also try to solve one of our needs. Potential targets here - Poeltl, Seth Curry, Cam Reddish, Justin Holiday

What route would you prefer? Any potential targets I missed? Personally I think we should wait the 20 or so games that they're planning to wait in order to see if Benchbrook keeps it up, guys like Jones/Nunn figure it out, how Bryant looks when he's back, etc. But for me, best case scenario is Benchbrook keeps this up, PatBev figures out his shooting to go along with the defense/leadership he brings and you're able to do #3 and bring in an upgrade to our shooting or size on a smaller deal.",1.0

*Jazz 2 times.

* Spurs 3 times.

* Pistons once.

* Pacers once.

No game is a gimme but those are 7 games I'll classify as a must win. Those are also the type of games we didn't take advantage of last season that bit us late when it came to play in seeding losing to OKC twice and to the Rockets and Spurs.

Kings are also in this 12 game stretch but they are no longer a walk over so I don't look at it as a game that's detrimental if we lose.",1.0
71,2022-11-04 16:31:42,ym3jo2,LeBron is going to turn it up,jphili,"I feel like people have missed how unimpressive (for his own standards) Lebron has been this season. Lebron‚Äôs current stats: 25.0 /9.0 / 7.4 on 43.9% fg%. His shooting and layups have been off, he‚Äôs looked sluggish at times. After this most recent game it came out that he has been battling some sort of flu-like illness. 

I know father time is undefeated, but this same man averaged over 30ppg last year on elite efficiency, dropped 56 against the warriors. I think he is capable of FAR better performances in the future. I think within the next 10-20 games, we will see Lebron return to close to 50% fg. If I were to bet, there will be a couple games he completely takes over. 

Calling it now, he will drop a 40 piece within a month or 2. I think it will also galvanize the team",1.0
