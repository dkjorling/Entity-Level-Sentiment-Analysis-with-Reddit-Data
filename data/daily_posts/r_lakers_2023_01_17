0,2023-01-18 07:16:28,10f140m,Would Kobe have benefitted/been even greater had he adopted a Lebron-like approach to the game?,jhofay1,"I've been watching some old 2013 highlights and I remembered how Kobe essentially drove himself into the ground to get the Lakers into the playoffs. Peak mamba, pure determination and willpower until his body gave out.

Comparing that to Lebron who has for years invested heavily into recovery, sleep science, hyperbaric chambers, whatever the cutting edge of training was he seemed to be on it...it got me thinking that could Kobe have been even greater than he was if he dialled back the mamba a bit and approached the game a little more holistically? Even if he never got injured. Possibly his late career focus on leadership would have come earlier and he could have had more success with Shaq. What are everyone's thoughts on this?",1.0

Now my question is who are we trading for, and which players are we sending out? Honest question. Because last time I check our cap space only allows us to sign 2 serviceable players, and we wont have any contracts to match salaries for any trade since most of our player's contracts expire at the end of the season. So what are the signings and trades that will make this team a contender again?",1.0

I hated LeBron from like 2006 til he joined the Lakers. Called him all the usual names, shared all the memes etc. Literally no other player I hated more.

Rondo obviously was someone I also hated but liked while he was on the team.

LeBron obviously stepped up, guys like Dennis, Thomas Bryant, Wenyen and even Russ have showed up at various times throughout the season. The good news is AD is coming back before the All-Star break. If we can stay healthy and make a run post allstar break we can definitely get into the playoffs and given how even the league looks, we'll have two of the best three players in every series.

26,2023-01-17 13:22:49,10ec5jb,Millionth trade proposal - my realistic dream trade,mxj7,"Let me start with this : With Westbrook's recent display, I think for the short term there's more upside in trading Pat + Nunn (and eventually Lonnie and JTA if necessary). But for the longer term vision and avoiding the ""rinse &amp; repeat"" we've done over the last few summers, it would be more beneficial to trade Russel's huge salary and get back players that we could keep long term.

So, assuming Gary Trent is open to re-signing with the lakers this summer (we already know Turner is VERY open), here's a trade I'd really really love to see : 

Westbrook + picks for Myles + Gary Trent. Spurs get included to take-on Westbrook's salary for a second rounder, and Lakers get back 2 wings (% wise, would be by far our best shooting wings on the roster). Spurs also get to dump the last year of Doug's contract. If necessary, I'd absolutely throw-in a second rounder to the raptors to make it happen.

Given Carlisle doesn't want to trade Myles, giving them TB might sweeten the deal (+ the big trade exception they generate). We won't be able to resign TB this summer anyway.
Since they don't take back any contract + get a first for an expiring contract (who doesn't want to resign), it's only fair that they are the ones to pay the spurs for facilitating the trade.

Salary-wise, we could keep Walker and still execute the trade. But we know our front-office really really doesn't want to pay any luxury tax, so sending out Lonnie balances the outgoing and incoming salaries.

Rotations post-trade : 
PatBev - Trent Jr - LeBron - AD - Turner
Schroeder - Reaves - Josh - Doug - Wenyens 

In the off-season, you get to start with a nucleus of Trent - Bron - AD - Turner alongwith Reaves - Doug - Wenyens. That's very solid compared to the last couple of summers we've had.
