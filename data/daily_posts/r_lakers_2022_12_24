6,2022-12-25 00:14:10,zumdxn,I asked an AI to write a short story about Kobe and Pac-Man.,superhabib,"Kind of eery how it did \*kinda\* well, and responded, just based on that prompt alone..

&amp;#x200B;

**Can you generate a short story about Kobe Bryant meeting Pac-Man?**

Kobe Bryant was a legendary basketball player who had achieved great success and fame during his career. One day, while training in the gym, he heard a strange noise coming from outside. He went to investigate and was shocked to find a large yellow dot bouncing around the court.

The dot introduced itself as Pac-Man, and Kobe was intrigued. He asked Pac-Man what he was doing in the gym, and the dot explained that he was on a journey to find the lost city of gold and needed help. Kobe was intrigued by the idea and decided to join Pac-Man on his quest.

So, together, Kobe and Pac-Man ventured deep into the jungle, encountering many strange and dangerous creatures along the way. Eventually, they stumbled across the lost city, but it was guarded by a mysterious force. In order to gain access to the city, Kobe and Pac-Man had to prove themselves worthy.

Kobe used his basketball skills to impress the guard and gain access to the city, and together, he and Pac-Man explored the lost city and discovered its many secrets. They eventually found the powerful artifact that Pac-Man had been searching for, and with it, they were able to make their way back home.

&amp;#x200B;

**What was the artifact?**

The artifact that Pac-Man was searching for in the temple was a powerful object with mysterious powers. It was said to be able to grant any wish, and the ghosts were guarding it to make sure it didn't fall into the wrong hands.

&amp;#x200B;

**What happened to Kobe and Pac-Man once they went home?**

Once Kobe and Pac-Man returned home, Kobe was able to use the artifact to make his wildest dreams come true. He used its power to become a famous basketball player and make a name for himself. As for Pac-Man, he was able to find the lost city of gold and use its wealth to become a famous explorer.

Kobe and Pac-Man remained close friends and often went on adventures together to explore the world and uncover its many secrets. They also used the artifact to make wishes come true for those in need, and in doing so, brought joy to many people around the world.

&amp;#x200B;

**Kobe Bryant was already a famous basketball player - it wouldn't make sense he became one after.**

That's true - Kobe Bryant was already a famous basketball player when he embarked on his quest with Pac-Man. However, the artifact enabled him to take his career to the next level. He was able to use its power to become an even more successful and renowned basketball player, and he was able to use the fame and recognition he gained to help those in need.

&amp;#x200B;

**But you said he used its power ""to become a famous basketball player"" - he was already famous. How could he use its power to become famous if he was already famous?**

Kobe Bryant was already a famous basketball player, but he was not yet a legend. The power of the artifact enabled him to take his career to the next level and become an even more successful and renowned basketball player. He was able to use the fame and recognition he gained to help those in need, and he was able to use it to inspire others with his story.",1.0

8,2022-12-24 23:53:52,zum0in,In Defense of Rob Pelinka,SidPhillips0430,"I see people constantly bashing Pelinka and Jeanie on here to karma farm from all the Bronsexuals who have infiltrated this sub and are looking for an outlet to vent. But I think it’s important to know that this sub is grossly exaggerating how poor of a job he’s done. He’s really only had one big mistake, and the culpability is shared there.

He traded the baby lakers for AD and built a title team. That was a win that year. I’ll admit that there is the question of whether injury prone AD and Lebron win the title that year without a 3 month break in the middle of the season. But they won in the conditions that were present. So a win.

The next year, pelinka retooled the team, and yes they lost in the first round to the suns, but that was more so a byproduct of Lebron and ad being injured. Pelinka put together a good team that at one point was the number one seed in the west and looked like the best team in the nba. If the league had another 3 month break this year, they probably win. Regardless, it was a good team until injuries took out their two best players. Injuries were the reason that season was a failure, not Pelinka.

The year after that they overreact and bring in Westbrook. This was a poor move, but let’s not pretend that it was Pelinka’s sole decision. Lebron, AD, and Westbrook got together for that famous meeting before the trade happened, and all these reports came out about how it was Lebron and AD who were pushing for this trade. This would fit Lebron’s schtick, since ever since Miami, this is how he tries to win titles. He tries to trade young players and role players for veteran star players to fast pass a title the super team way. He just fucked up this time. But this failure isn’t entirely on Pelinka and is as much a byproduct of him listening to his star players’ desires.

This season looks to be lousy as well, and the lakers are on track to miss the playoffs. But wtf do you expect him to do? The lakers pay his checks, not Lebron. His loyalty is to the lakers. Westbrook comes off the books after this season. I’m not sure trading away future assets and mortgaging the future to a 38 year old player who has been hurt every season he’s been in LA except when he got a 3 month break is the best option. Ditto for AD. Is this guy really it? He played out of his mind for 2 weeks. But it wasn’t like he was playing 46 mins a game like old Kobe before he tore his Achilles. Dude literally was playing 36 mins a game and broke his foot via air. What evidence in the last few years is there to suggest that Lebron and AD will even be healthy come playoff time to convince Pelinka to mortgage the future for two injury prone players, one of whom is 38?

The smart option is to punt this season, let Westbrook walk, and see what can happen with his money off the books. I got news for you: fucking buddy hield and Myles turner aren’t making this team a championship contender. There aren’t really any options here for Pelinka to make.",1.0

16,2022-12-24 17:59:43,zuf13e,A consistent and statistical look into what’s not working for the lakers. Last night Russ was +8 and Lebron was -6 but you’d think according to the fan base it were the opposite. Lebron is stuck playing with a worthless 1-3 trio and a 5 costar who’s injured,Freeeecurry,"This is by no means an attack on Lebron, he single-handedly took over in the 4th but it’s an objective perspective to counter his stans. 

The starting lineup has been designed to enable Lebron and create spacing, not necessarily ensure team wins.
Last night Bev and Dennis were both -8 individually and more interestingly in less than 9 minutes played TBJ was an atrocious -11.

Bron finished -6 even after the takeover in the 4th which speaks volumes in how bad the starting lineup is due to the trio of Lonnie, Bev, and Dennis. Dennis is allergic to creating. He has no business starting

As things currently stand Russ is the best playmaker on the team and the best floor raiser for the bigs and spacing with his ability to crash the lane and find open guys on the perimeter especially reaves.

The best lineup yesterday was a combination of Russ, Lebron, reaves, and wenyen yet ham went back to Dennis and Bev in the clutch.

The truth is Dennis is doing nothing to make lebrons role easier, he brings the ball up court and hands it off to Bron on screens where Bron usually settles for a jumper.

In contrast when Russ plays with pace we open up transition baskets and make it that much easier for Lebron to score. In fact this team as constructed is only good when playing with pace and in transition.

The issue is, if we’re seeing this surely ham and his staff are so it begs to ask you wtf is really going on?",1.0
