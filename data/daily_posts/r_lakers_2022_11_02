Ham willing to make the proper adjustments and get more shooting on the floor (shout out Matty Ice) was really impressive. Also very happy with Russ being able to accept and excel at his role. Although I‚Äôm watching the postgame interview and he didn‚Äôt seem in a great mood despite the win.

I have been especially impressed by his defense so far. Spurs fans and advanced stats nerds were saying that he was horrid on that end, so I was really concerned about it. However, it really looks like he put in the work on that end this past summer. 

Offensively, after struggling a little bit at first, he‚Äôs starting to find his stride, as of late, carrying us on several occasions when we‚Äôve need it.

What a steal of a signing in retrospect, man.

I would be willing to trade the two picks and Russ for Beasley, Conley and Vanderbilt. That would give us the depth and still maintain our defensive effort. 

Im not sure I want Kyrie with all the drama. 

What do others think?",0.29

108,2022-11-02 22:35:13,ykk2sj,"Assuming Lakers don't want to give up picks in the trades and are looking for the 2023 free agency to improve the roster, they would be having around 30 million in cap space. Thats simply not enough to improve the roster to a championship calibre roster imo.",TheWhisperingDeath,"Firstly, the free agency class ain't that great. The truly top tier free agents like Harden, Kyrie, Middleton and FVV will all cost more than 30 odd million. Kyrie possibly may take a pay cut because no one would want to touch him with a barge pole.

Lakers can have the likes of Draymond, Porzingis, Turner, Poeltl, Grant and Kuzma etc but they will take up majority of the 30 odd million and Lakers will be left with very little then to improve the roster afterwards.

Also, if Lakers decide to go down that path, they will end up losing salary cap fillers like Russ and Pat Bev for nothing. They will once again be in the same situation they were sometime back where they don't have enough contracts to move around to get a player even from a trade later down the line.

I think right now is Lakers' best opportunity to improve the roster if they really want to compete for the Championship in the next couple of years. Because you have expiring contracts who you can pair up with the picks and get players back in return and then hopefully secure them long term. Guys like Rozier + Oubre + Hayward or Turner + Buddy are going to be better than any combination of players Lakers will be able to get in the free agency in all likelihood.",0.74
