5,2023-02-15 04:40:40,112pmot,An Anthony Davis Descriptive Analytics Breakdown: Fro vs No Fro,kiwiwikikiwiwikikiwi,"Anthony Davis has played in 34 games this season. 5 of those games have been with a fro. He has played in 29 other games with braids. 

As some have observed, Fro AD plays more passive and inefficient, so I wanted to see how the numbers look. And below are the general stat findings for this season: 

&amp;#x200B;

||PTS|REB|FG%|3PT%|FT%|BLK|STL|TO|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|FRO|21.2|**15.2**|48.2|0|78.8|**2.2**|.6|**3.4**|
|NO FRO|**26.8**|11.9|**55.5**|**25.5**|**80.5**|2.0|**1.3**|2.0|

Fro AD in his last 4 games has been shadow of his normal self. The only outlier of the 5 games total is fro AD during November 18th, where he scored 38 pts and 16 rebounds on 62.5% FG. Remove this game and he is actually averaging **17 pts and 15 rebounds on 44% FG** in the 4 fro games post-injury. Dreadful.

AD with braids (""Brai-D"") is still an all-star caliber player. But will he cut his hair in time to save the season? We'll just have to wait and see.

But this was me just wondering how badly he was playing ever since he switched hairstyles (and really his foot injury that has screwed him over). Wanted to share the pretty obvious findings. Lemme know what you think! 

For the next breakdown, I might wanna look at the numbers and coaching schemes for when Darvin Ham decided to let the offense run through our guards (Dennis/Reaves/Lonnie) instead of...you know...our superstar championship duo in Bron/AD. Because imagine you are a coach in the NBA, and are given 2 top 10 players in the league, and you decide to prioritize touches for your role players instead...

But anyways, hope the big guy can recover to 80-90% of himself. Cause we're really gonna need him if we hope to make the play-ins and beyond. 

Have a Happy V-Day y'all. Stay safe. Go Lakers üò§üíúüíõ",1.0

I chose what I felt was the most representative lineup of each era, and tried to pick the lineup that was on the court during the respective Finals.  There are a few exceptions, for instance even though Baylor wasn‚Äôt on the court for the 1972, he was a key member of
the 1960s Lakers that were basically runners up to Boston every year (ugh), and while Cooper didn‚Äôt close games from my viewings, I had to include him as part of any 1980s Lakers teams.

30,2023-02-14 08:38:38,111xudw,"The Lakers is done this year, Coaching matter in the NBA",Nonameheroz,"Darwin Ham is as bad as Steve Nash and Luke Walton.

Luke Walton is super stubborn and bad rotation.
Ham actually beats him in those department, I didn‚Äôt even know it is possible.

We messed up not getting Lue.
Never should have let Vogel go.
Though one thing about Vogel annoyed me is how he only make adjustment a bit slow, like how he almost purposely lose game 1 in the playoff.  But he is like a genius compare to Ham.

Ham is in love with player just small guards lineup.

And when we traded away all the smart guards, he still finds a way to play the only 2 point guards we have together starting. Makes me want to rage and throw something at him. It is like he is purposely sabotaging our season.

We need to fire him like tomorrow.
I just can‚Äôt watch this.
The dude is really clueless.
Our front officer hired him really show incompetency too. We hired Luke too.

And also it is over for Lebron.
The NBA wants him to fade into the retirement.
The ref this year cost us like multiple games, without that, we would not be in a must win every gam until playoff.

The Boston game made it clear to me.
NBA needs new superstar to take over.

They can‚Äôt have the Jordan thing happen again where he retired after winning, and the rating all drop to bottom.

Same thing happened to Kobe, NBA literally stopped the Chris Paul trade to make sure Kobe slowly fade into irrelevance in term of winning.

When you are too big of a star, the NBA had learnt from Michael Jordan mistake that it needs you to fade into the shadow instead going out with a bang, and bring viewership down when u retire.

NBA is a business and it needs focus on creating new super stars like the Boston pairs.",1.0
