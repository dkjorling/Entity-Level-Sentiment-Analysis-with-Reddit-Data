They tried to win and came back from large deficits. Last years team would‚Äôve lost by 60 both games. So what they suck scoring. That will come. Everyone is getting to know each other. I expect fully bounce back win and a big ass win streak starting next week. 

F the haters! And never forget. We had a 3-1 lead against Steve Nash/Amare. With Kobe and Smush. 

Westbrook isn‚Äôt the root of all evil. Nobody is. Team will jell and everything wil fall into its course. I just put 5k on LA making a deeper run in the Playoffs than the Warriors. 

This post has nothing to do with the money, we are 4 threes away of 2 Wins. Relax. Don‚Äôt get bothered guys. Season literally just started.

Even a little production offensively from Bev/Russ/Nunn and that game would of been ours. I hope to see Nunn especially step up offensively. And hopefully Schroeder will be a resource when this sort of brick house starts happening.

And defensively as a team I think we‚Äôve looked good especially in game 2. Yes our shooting was atrocious and we‚Äôre not a good shooting team so we can‚Äôt expect too much but we‚Äôre not going to shoot 35% and 20% every game.

However, as trash as Rob is, you guys do realize Jeanie is the one who extended him recently? I know it may be a long shot for Jeanie to actually sell the team. But I still believe the Buss family selling majority team stake (for billions of dollars) while retaining a minority stake could be a relative win-win for both fans and the Buss family. Even if she is unlikely to sell the team, I say we make that our chant until we see continued competence. To let our feelings be known. I wish #SellTheTeamJeanie was viral to apply some sort of pressure on our terrible and incompetent ownership/FO. 

I hear another Laker fan is trying to organize a protest and seeing a lot of people clowning him. If you can‚Äôt attend, fine. But why clown someone who is displaying passion? In fact, the last time Lakers‚Äô fans had a protest, we won the chip afterwards lol. Not to say that I could attend at all, but I prefer that type of fan over the ‚Äúfan‚Äù who is going to stop watching 10 games into our season. 

Final thought. Hopefully we don‚Äôt lose leverage as we wait to make a trade until closer to the deadline. I‚Äôve outlined the pros and cons of this strategy before. Pro: We may strike a better deal by waiting until we get closer to the trade deadline. Con: We may go 10-25 and already be out of it by then, especially with this tougher early schedule
