0,2022-10-12 06:00:24,y1vrs0,Just a thought … but I think Lebron is desperate to win it all this year.,-CamSWorld-,"I just thought about how when after the finals 2 years ago, Lebron gave a speech and said “ I want my damn respect “. To me, that’s saying. Despite his over accomplished career. Lebron knows the world will not crown him the Goat unless he wins more than 4 championships (at least 5 to tie Kobe, undisputed Goat at 6 rings).  Lebron getting older, and With this season being the year he earns the scoring title, I think he knows it’s do or die. If he can retire with at least 1 more ring and the scoring title I believe he ties Jordan in the goat race. 

And If steph wins another ring this year over Lebron, sad to say but Lebron legacy will be tarnished for good.

Edit: I know I made alot of fans mad with this one 🤭 feel free to let me how bad it hurts below 👇🏾

Edit: it’s not that I’m not right, I’m not right, right now .",0.16
