11,2023-02-07 00:45:26,10vnjc0,Coldcocksandwich question of the day: Beal or Lavine?,Coldcocksandwich,"Hypothetical speaking, if the lakers had the opportunity to trade for Bradley Beal or Zach Lavine, who would you prefer? This would probably include both picks. 

Seems unrealistic on the surface but gives both teams the ability to blow it up and start a rebuild. 

Bonus question: If the answer is Lavine, would you take a flyer on Lonzo and his mystery knee pain as part of the package? 

To me, I give Lavine the slight edge. I think he‚Äôs a little more big time and has LA experience playing for UCLA. Bringing Lonzo home and having him regain his health is my personal pipe dream. Thoughts?",1.0
