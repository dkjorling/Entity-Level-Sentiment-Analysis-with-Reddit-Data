9,2022-10-13 03:35:10,y2oa1l,I hate 4 guard basketball,3nnui,"Ugly first half, we shoot 2-18 from 3. Naz Reid looking to put up 40. Edwards and Dlo able to bully their matchup to any spot on the floor they want then raise up for an easy shot, and if AD comes over, then another ez bucket for Reid. We cannot secure defensive rebounds. Wolves getting easy transition points even when we are back because they are all 4 inches taller and 30 pounds heavier at every position but 5. I think the poor 3 point shooting is a function of being tired from boxing out, and having a larger defender able to close out and contest without worrying about the drive because plenty of help inside if they fly by.

I guess JTA is not going to play this game, he would help a lot. But I would rather see Wenyen take the floor at the 4 or play the centers more, so we are not looking at mismatches across the board. In some cases 4 guard basketball can work, when people are tired, when you need to make a comeback. But going with it early emboldens the other team to play aggressively and punish you on every play. This was the worst looking basketball of the preseason so far other than some blowouts of the south bay guys in the 3rd quarter. 

I hope we don't do this again.",0.89

15,2022-10-13 01:28:14,y2lnvm,I love the underdog mentality that we have. And I think this will lead to our championship.,junahn,"This year, bleacherreport, espn and other media predicted lakers to be at 9th seed in the West, above other tanking teams. And none of them are expecting us to win the chip nor the health of our main guys. 

And I can see that everyone in our roster are committed to teamwork, defense, and hustles that we couldn't see last year. Lebron and Russ seemed to be more willing on playing defense and AD worked dead hard on his shooting. We got more glue guys, Reaves from last year, Beverly, JTA, Christie to contribute for the team's success. 

Under Lebron James's leadership(And lebron always thrived when his team was underappreciated and considered as underdogs) I solely believe that this team can top all the team in the playoffs, and I dont care who we meet in the playoffs too. Warriors, clippers, nuggets, timberwolves, whatever. 

And I am calling this team to win the title. Although it might be a little early, as a fan, I just believe that unless you support tanking team you should believe your team no matter what circumstances.",0.58

Some of y‚Äôall are still upset that Russ is still here and rightfully so - last season was a fuckin nightmare‚Ä¶but this season feels so different and I know y‚Äôall feel it too.

Russ seems bought in so far and I‚Äôm ready for him and Dennis revenge tour. Our guard rotation has young, athletic, hungry and unproven players like Lonnie and Reaves who seem committed to Darvin‚Äôs vision. Nunn has been brilliant. I believe they will defend hard, and run, run, run. They all echo the ‚Äúrunning habits‚Äù theme Ham has constantly preached (AR even mentioned it on the laker nation podcast recently). JTA has looked fantastic in the role he will have. The jury is still out on TBJ. Bev will have a major impact. AD has looked dominant and bron is bron. Wenyen has surprised me and although Jones and Bryant have been a bit iffy, I trust Ham‚Äôs history with bigs.

I think we will surprise a lot of people this year including some our fans. Fuck it I‚Äôm just gonna say it. Top 4 seed and top 5 defense üò§ Can‚Äôt wait til next week!
