Who even before the trade, was ideal for the Nets or most other teams in need of a strong defensive anchor Center. Because in that three team deal, this is all the Cavs had to give up, to acquire Jarrett Allen.

Cavs trade: G Dante Exum &amp; 2022 first-round pick (via Milwaukee) to Houston | 2024 second-round pick to Brooklyn.

Back when this deal happened in January 2021, Lakers couldn‚Äôt have traded their 2021 first rounder (which was later traded for Westbrook anyway) and a future 2nd rounder to make this happen? And Dante Exum was just salary filler since he had no value as a player.

Just a shame because an AD and Allen frontcourt would have been suffocating for opposing offenses.",0.38

Next year, the Lakers could have both Benchbrook and Myles Turner, and if they buy in and sign for smaller contracts, they could get more, possibly someone better than Buddy Hield, without giving up 2 First Round Picks.",0.79
