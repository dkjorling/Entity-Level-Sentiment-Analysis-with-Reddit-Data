He’s clearly better suited to be a wing defender, it’s a good sign that Ham played only AD and Mo at center",T_025,,1.0

I enjoy the players today getting wide open because I know there’s a good chance it’s going in, talking about D’Lo mostly. I bet Lebron and AD do too. 

Does anyone else feel this way? I forgot what this feels like after losing KCP and co.",1.0

12,2023-02-17 17:09:12,114rz7d,Who are our likely targets with the 2023 FRP?,tsesarevichalexei,"With all of the team options and players on bird rights that we have, most of the roster seems pretty set (and that’s a good thing). 

Furthermore, we might need to use the TPMLE to keep one of Dennis or Troy, considering how mid to weak the FA class is this summer.

Therefore, the most intriguing question (and one that I’m surprised many people haven’t discussed here already) is who we’re going to select with that first-round pick. Assuming that we’re the 7th-10th seed and that the Pelicans stay close to us in the standings, our pick is probably going to be somewhere around #25.

Personally, I’d like to get another two-way stopper who can guard the elite guards in the West (ala KCP/Caruso), while Vando and AD can stay on the bigger players. 

One of the few weaknesses of this current roster imo is that we don’t have a player that can effectively guard someone like Booker, for example. Vando can guard 1-5, but if he’s guarding Booker, who’s guarding KD? AD can certainly do it, but having someone who can more exclusively guard those quick guards and free Vando to more exclusively defend bigger wing players would be great, imo.",1.0

16,2023-02-17 16:07:16,114q5iv,A little reminder about Malik Beasley,Kanajeji,"Given this fanbase's tumultuous history with players like Danny Green and KCP, I think now is a good time to remind you guys that Beasley is just as streaky as those guys. He'll have nights where he looks like Steph and then nights where he bricks everything. But you guys should appreciate the gravity that these guys have even when they're not hitting shots and understand that streakiness is part and parcel with all shooters. Hopefully fans have learnt their lesson by now and we don't have another Danny Green situation which by the way those responsible for should be ashamed of themselves. Just a little reality check as we sit here in the honeymoon phase awaiting the team's return to action.",1.0
