We do the Myles Turner deal and we are right there. 

Reaves, Buddy, Bron, AD, Turner

Bev, Lonnie, TBJ, Wenyen, TB

Schroeder- 3rd string guard that can create offense and defend in case a guard is injured

Christie- a wing that can defend the opposing teams best player who‚Äôs 3 ball has been improving 

JTA- another wing that can guard bigger guys and brings good energy in short spurts when he‚Äôs on

Ryan- a shooter that can provide a boost in a pinch if a guy is hurt 

Jones - lost cause/ trade him away/cut him if needed 

Nunn- trade away as soon as possible 

Like that‚Äôs a solid ass team. We right there though.",0.72

20,2022-11-23 05:59:57,z2h12r,Lakers Observations,jaychilled,"(TLDR at bottom)
Finally faced a really good team during the win streak and am happy to say this team can compete with the best of them but just wanna see if anybody agrees with what I think are negatives , positives and easy adjustments from this past stretch of games

Negatives

Shot making 

 to me that really stand out are open shot making and lineups. This team has to play almost perfect to stay in a game because the perimeter shooting is so awful while almost every other team takes and makes a variety of shots, contested or not while lakers aren‚Äôt consistent enough on wide open jumpers 
 
Lineups

hams lineups are reaching Vogel levels of bad, Schroeder, Westbrook, nunn and pat bev / lonnie lineups with like Bryant at the 5, Schroeder is always paired with Westbrook , brown/Lonnie is taken out the game before Beverly always. I think nunn is worthless , Beverly is close to that and shroeder needs more time but he has offered nothing(maybe due with who‚Äôs beside him ) but still.  
It‚Äôs bothered me more than anything because the offense isn‚Äôt good enough to gift the other team 2-5 minutes of bad basketball

Positives 

Players are stepping up, AD is playing like the best player on the team, and not this suns game but perimeter players have been making shots finally. And even when they weren‚Äôt making shots they still were hanging wit the suns

Westbrook hitting shots , creating offense and playing defense like he does is really helpful 

Austin reaves being comfortable hitting jumpers off the pnr, spot up and jus being more aggressive is nice 

Etc 
I think nunn and pat bev need to see severe minute restriction , max christie should take nunns minutes completely. 

TLDR , I never felt this team was as hopeless as last season even with this bad roster construction and they are proving why. Extremely fixable issues and this team margin for error is small if they continue to be bad from the perimeter . AD is the ultimate band aid especially if he plays at that level",1.0
21,2022-11-23 05:56:43,z2gyx0,This Team Is Making It Extremely Obvious How Much Hield &amp; Turner Would Benefit,Vexationss,"The Lakers were 4/22 from three tonight (18.2%)

If the Lakers even bumped that number to 8 threes made or 10 threes made the are celebrating Anthony Davis incredible night with a W.

Buddy Hield is what this team is begging for when you look at it, he is shooting 38% on high attempted threes per game which is extremely good. I can‚Äôt tell you how many ways he would benefit this team rn which is starting to trend up.

Myles Turner is also having s very nice season and is a stretch 5 and I‚Äôm pretty sure he wants to be in LA. He would be monster with AD offensively and defensively.

Rob you are already doing a considerable malpractice this year at GM. You can fix it with that trade, it‚Äôs been on the table and yes it‚Äôs a sacrifice of picks but you cannot waste AD nights like this or when LeBron does similar.",1.0
22,2022-11-23 05:56:17,z2gylw,Anyone else think it‚Äôs cringe how hard the Suns try to be our rivals?,Gaeulsae,"I just don‚Äôt understand why there is all this hostile energy coming towards us over there in phoenix. The way the players act and carry themselves every time they play us, you‚Äôd think they are our rivals or something lol. It‚Äôs cute that they‚Äôve been to one finals and they wanna act all tough on us. I get that LA teams have historically trashed Arizona sports in the past, but they‚Äôre gonna need at least 17 more rings to be our rivals",1.0
23,2022-11-23 05:51:52,z2gvrc,"when Suns are hitting long 2s and 3s, it's better to play Matt Ryan anyway",MITWestbrook,"Suns were scorching hot today. They were making all jumpers.

In order to match the firepower Lakers would've been better off playing Matt Ryan big minutes over Bev and Schroeder.

It was a game of offense where no defense could stop Suns shot making.

So it's not worth playing players that are one way defensively.

Please Ham. Play Matt Ryan if this happens again. This reminds me of the Kings game.",1.0

79,2022-11-22 20:09:49,z23kab,Why does Ham keep insisting on playing Kendrick Nunn over Matt Ryan?,TorontoRaptors34,"I understand the whole defense, defense, defense shit. 

However, I will always go for size any day. Kendrick Nunn is a small guard who can't defend either and has had a string of 0 point games. Matt Ryan is also responsible for one of this teams wins. Nunn I understand is coming off an injury riddled season but the team has looked better without him. Not to mention Dennis imo if u give him all Nunn's mins I feel he will look far superior. U also got Beverly. All these guys are essentially the same size so why play them all together. 

Matt Ryan to me has a very short leash. He is a shooter on a team thats been criticized for its poor shooting. Why not give him and Dennis all of Nunn's mins. You don't need to give Matt 30 mins but 10-13 wouldn't be bad. He plays with confidence and can give u a few 3s a game which is well needed. On defense he not the best but can at least serve as a decoy thanks to his size, while Nunn can't guard a fly. 

Not to mention as far as pg's u got Russ whos making many guys around him better and embracing that 6th man role perfectly. Then u got Reaves who is really stepping up to the plate with that role making smart choices as well as being able to disguise himself as a 2 or 3 as well. He's also been proven to shine in a bigger role. Lonnie is also solid with the ball in his hands too. Then u have Bron need I say more. Kendrick Nunn is very redundant and is not showing up. Even when he shoots it just looks accidental if it goes in and has only looked good in garbage time. To me Nunn and Jones have to replaced asap. 

To me I believe Reaves should be a starting pg. Bev should also come otb. Dennis should be there kinda as maybe a starter or maybe just a luxury given how Russ is been playing as a 6th man. Nunn shouldn't see any mins.",1.0

81,2022-11-22 19:11:00,z2218i,With Lebron‚Äôs adductor strain and lingering groin issues it‚Äôs unrealistic to expect him to be a driver of the basketball or full time point guard until he gets adequate rest,Freeeecurry,"The lakers are at a peculiar crossroads. They seemed to have solved the issue of Lebron and Russ‚Äôs fit temporarily for it to backfire with Bron straining his adductor and groin again

This means Bron shouldn‚Äôt focus on driving and doing anything to strain it further until it fully heals. The issue is that on a guard dominant roster only Bron, Reaves, and Russ have shown playmaking potential

The positives of reaves are that he can create his own shot and create for others but more or less on a secondary playmaker level. He is more likely to be attacked and turn it over without Bron or Russ sharing minutes with him to distribute the ball. 

Nunn has proven more of being a 2 guard who should focus primarily on spot up shooting or self creation. 

Beverly has really struggled offensively personally and creating offense for others. At the very best you could call him a defensive specialist. 

Schroeders self creation has looked good but the offense has looked very dry in his minutes. 

The offense has really shined under Russ especially in the past three games with Bryant returning. He has really carved out a role for wenyen, Bryant, and created great chemistry with AD and others. 

Interestingly enough his assist to turnover ratio has been 3:1 in this stretch and for the first time in forever finished his first game as Ham has been very adamant about reeling him in when he tends to do too much leading to turnovers or mistakes which is a great stride in him carving out his role and getting over the terrible start to the season and what was last season. 

If Russ can produce and produce efficiently, and we keep Bron healthy with injury prevention in mind we have the ability to make some sort of run until Bron becomes healthy again. The lakers don‚Äôt have to trade both picks but they should use one to get off bev and nunn for upgrades whether at the wing or center position. 

Fan base needs to stop the whole stan thing and think collectively which I‚Äôm sure is the plan Ham will employ anyways",1.0

86,2022-11-22 16:48:41,z1yf4i,Thomas Bryant is last year‚Äôs Ariza but for real.,william4534,"Remember last year with the whole ‚Äújust wait until Ariza‚Äôs back‚Äù? I feel like that‚Äôs Thomas Bryant this year. He‚Äôs moving really well, running the break with Westbrook, and he‚Äôs looking like a genuine force inside. For the first time in a while, I watched a Lakers center not fold immediately once someone close to his size was on him. He‚Äôs also been a monster on the boards, grabbing some that look way out of reach. Seeing as rebounding is consistently an underrated issue with our team, this is huge. Most importantly, however, is the fact that he allows AD to get some time at the 4, where he‚Äôs known to dominate. 

I think we genuinely can go on a serious winstreak here and maybe reach .500 by Christmas, and for those even more optimistic, keep in mind that last year‚Äôs Celtics were under .500 at new years.",1.0

96,2022-11-22 10:50:09,z1qjob,Terry Rozier should be the Lakers target in a realistic 3-team deal...,makethetradepelinka,"Eric Pincus wrote an article on a 3-team deal that would fix the Lakers roster...in theory it would be a tremendous deal...but in reality the Nets are probably still committed to Kyrie Irving past this season...since he doesn't have much trade value and they have his bird rights...plus Kyrie is not the most stable personality to bank on...whos knows what controversy he might spark up next...

The framework of the trade is still solid...Pincus just didnt have the right point guard in mind...how about instead of the Lakers-Pistons-Nets...the real 3-team deal would be Lakers-Pistons-Hornets...the deal would still involve the 27 &amp; 29 picks but instead of targeting Kyrie... Lakers would get Terry Rozier instead...Rozier is already signed long term so no need to worry about resigning him in the off-season...Rozier fits perfectly with Lebron &amp; AD to complete a better big 3 @ half the salary of what Kyrie or Bradley Beal would cost the Lakers to acquire...

the way I would structure the deal is a 4 for 4 trade...Lakers give up their 4 worst contracts and pickup 4 players that will fill all the holes in the roster...

Lakers get: Terry Rozier, Bojan Bogdanovic, Mason Plumlee, Alex Burks...

Hornets get: 27' 1st, Pat Bev, Nunn, Nerlens Noel [from pistons]

Pistons get: 29' 1st, Westbrook, Damion Jones...

they great thing about this trade is every team has major incentives to make a deal...Hornets and Pistons are already in the Wemby sweepstakes as the two worst teams in the east...both teams have incentives to start shedding long term salary and veteran contracts immediately...Terry Rozier is year 1 of a four year deal which means a team would have to commit long term cap space to acquire him plus give draft compensation... How many contending teams are willing to do that for 6'2 point guard??... Bogdanovic just signed an extension...Pistons are going nowhere so any team willing to offer a 1st Rd. Pick could easily acquire him... Burks and Plumlee are good veteran players on expiring deals...Lakers could maybe throw in a 2nd Rd. picks to grease the deal... 

no waiting on teams to turn direction and decide to blow up the season...waiting for star players to demand to be traded to the Lakers...all that is just wild speculation that is not likely to happen anytime soon...this trade can be completed anytime after Dec. 15th...

this proposed trade gives the Lakers roster everything its missing...size to complement AD... perimeter shooting...big wing...bench depth...Terry Rozier is the perfect #3 to compliment Lebron &amp; AD...he would excel as the point guard flanked by those two mega stars...the same time you shed all the bloated contracts and dead weight holding this squad back from being a contender...this is the deal Rob Pelinka should be pursuing yesterday with teams that have incentive to work with the Lakers to get a deal done...

oh did I mention that this deal would net the Lakers 7.5 million in total roster salary savings...saving Jeanie Buss over 30 MILLION in luxury taxes...WHAT THE HELL IS PELINKA WAITING FOR...you see my handle dammit...",1.0
