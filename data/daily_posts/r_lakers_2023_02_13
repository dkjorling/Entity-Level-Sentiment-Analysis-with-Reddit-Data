&amp;#x200B;

NBA Cap for next season is $134M with a Luxury Tax that starts around $165M. Lakers are both repeaters, and almost a full max contract above the cap. 

Regardless though, the roster is basically fine for the next year so long as we negotiate good deals with our guys. The Tax Payer MLE could go to Shroeder and we basically run it back this year. If Anthony Brown takes another Vet Min, he'll have early-bird rights. I think we move on from Lonnie Walker and Shroeder and use the MLE to try to sign a starting SG/SF. 

The Nuggets' Bruce Brown kind of perfectly fits what we need despite his 6""4 height.  

**The real issue is more about Laker's spending. My thoughts below:** 

I could see us trying to make some cuts to avoid a $60M Luxury Tax bill. 

For starters, getting discounts on Russell, Hachimura, Reaves as I listed is good. 

If they aren't successful there, I could see the Lakers guaranteeing Beasly's $16M for his final year, trading him an under the Cap Team and taking the trade exception and some 2nd rounders. Or just allowing him to expire and use a TP-MLE to save $10M on that roster spot.

That would drop the Lakers Luxury Tax into the $20-30M range.

I'm not worried much on Lakers cheeping out a ton. For one, the Luxury Tax is calculated at the end of the season. The likelihood that our entire roster that's making over $8M is healthy and contributing is low. If we need to drop someone and grab a vet, we'll have three rookies to dangle and we're fine with 2nd rounders. 

If they are? The Lakers can manage one year of overpayment. Especially if it gives them something to whine about going into CBA Negotiations. They can say, look, we want to make sure that the league isn't just ultra billionaires using outside money to prop up contenders is broken. And when someone like LeBron or Kobe comes along, dropping a valuable player that's only $10M but will make the difference of $70M in tax payments is also broken. 

It hurts ownership of an NBA team.

That's a big down payment on getting rid of onerous Luxury Tax Payments that really do hamper the Buss family's ability to profit AND compete. 

Two years of fielding this roster might not work. But after that, there's relief anyways. LeBron won't be getting $50M from the Lakers.",1.0
