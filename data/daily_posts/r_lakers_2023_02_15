60,2023-02-15 22:29:06,113ah87,AD is a 4 not a 5. When are they going to realize that?,Barnnz,"AD hates playing the 5. That is one reason to stop doing it. If a player hates doing something, you're not getting their best effort. But further to this, you're removing AD's best skill: **HELP DEFENSE**

AD cannot play drop coverage and then help all in the same possession. It is physically impossible for any human to do this. AD is the best help defender in the world and we're taking him totally away from performing that skill. That is madness. 

Back track to the championship season, AD was flying in on help defense to block shots and protect the rim. You don't even need a good C next him. Just someone to stop the ball for a second or two to allow AD to recover from the perimeter and help.

Last reason to not start him at C: **Screens.** AD does not make contact or screens or even attempt to make contact. Why? I don't know. Every single other 5 man in the league can make contact at least a little bit. Maybe this is way of showing the coaching staff he hates playing C. This one is baffling. The lack of contact on screens hurts the guards scoring creation. Mainly D'Lo's pull up game. Get Bamba in there setting hard screens please. 

&amp;#x200B;

The lineup should be:  


PG: D'lo

SG: Reaves/Beasley

SF: LeBron

PF: Davis

C: Bamba
