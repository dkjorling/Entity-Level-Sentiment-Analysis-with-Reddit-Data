That said, the Lakers should resign him if they can retain him anywhere in the 10-20 million range. He makes boneheaded plays at times, but those mistakes can be contained if he's playing 25-30 minutes most nights and not necessarily included in crunch time. Westbrook is a valuable asset off the bench who can be an excellent playmaker and keep the offense going when LeBron is on the bench.",0.5

LeBron is incapable of Guarding wings at a high level for a long period of time.

We had 53 minutes of evidence vs Boston of the coaches and Lebron himself doing whatever to avoid guarding Tatum and Brown unless he absolutely had to which was down the stretch of the game.

I don't think Lebron wants to play the 3 anymore and quiet frankly don't think he's capable defensively anymore to play the wing.
