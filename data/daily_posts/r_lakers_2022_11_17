I am very disappointed in what I see as hypocrisy from the NBA and Lebron in reference to the Kyrie situation.  If a white player had endorsed a book that was as anti-black as Kyrie’s was Anti-Semitic you know the NBA would have burned the relationship immediately.  

Lebron coming out and supported a shortened suspension for Kyrie i was so disappointed.  Seems like racism is OK as long as it’s not against African Americans.  I’ve not liked all the “white boy” comments Lebron has made about his teammates but this for me is unacceptable.

If kyrie does return to the NBA as a player I will be done with the league and the Lakers.  It hurts man, loved and supported this team for 30 years but apparently the league is full of hatred and bigotry and no one cares.",1.0

18,2022-11-17 23:24:55,yy4wyx,"HEY MRS, BUSS DONT TRADE RUSS",BoosterSpeed31,"So, I know there is a lot of talk about trading going on but i think it would not be good to trade any one at the moment because it seems like the team is starting to pull itself together slowly. So, the win against the Brookyln Nets was a breath of fresh air but at the same time they had a few star players out. Russell Westbrook is looking a lot better and A.D was looking decent, but I still think the team was lacking some and the only reason we got the Win is because a lot of the guys who took shots for the Nets just couldn't shoot and gave a lot of turnovers. So, what do yall think is a trade a good idea or a bad one ...... I think it's a bad one cause the team is just now starting to build a chemistry together and making better plays that the very first part of the season .... So how do yall feel???? I just don't see giving up Top Draft Picks as a good idea for older players when you could get younger ones that could give a longer career to the team and possibly bring us to that level of a championship team.",0.18
