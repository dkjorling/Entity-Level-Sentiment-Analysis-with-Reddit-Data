4,2023-03-28 03:55:32,124btjm,[Meta] State of the sub,brandoi,"Hi all,

The mods, along with a lot of you guys, have noticed the increase in hateful comments as well as the comments surrounding them. We recognize that some of us as mods have been pretty lenient on moderating these types of comments.

While we can't control what's targeted to players in their social media/outside of this sub, we want to start becoming more strict of hateful comments that are made here towards the team. Temporary to permanent bans will be handed out to redditors that make non-basetball related hateful comments towards the team. Please continue to use the report feature so it's more easily brought to our attention.

Additionally, this also applies to anyone that visits other team subs and spread the same negativity. This shouldn‚Äôt even be a reminder, however some have decided that it‚Äôs okay to troll and brigade other subreddits. This is another warning that brigading will NOT be tolerated. If a scenario opens up, in which a moderator from any subreddit claims you have been brigading, we will not hesitate to take action that will lead to a temporary ban and could even result in a permanent ban.

With all that said, we recognize that r/Lakers is still a forum and fans come here as an outlet to share their joys and vent their frustrations. We don't want to censor anyone with their criticisms on players or coaches, but continue to encourage the constructive criticism and discussion. 

Thanks, and let's make the playoffs!!

18,2023-03-27 18:11:22,123v94z,The next two games will challenge some of the lakers core issues,suhar97,"Let‚Äôs start with talking through our main issues:

- turnovers 

- energy / competitive fire 

- shot distribution 

- inability to handle strong perimeter defense (tied to turnovers) 

Chicago and Minnesota will both try to capitalize on all of the above to get wins against the Lakers. We struggle w physical perimeter defenders who do not allow our smaller / less physical guards to engage the defense the way they want to (see: losses to Minnesota, New York, Chicago). 

In addition, the time has gone for two things: 1) not being able to get your best players shots and 2) coming out flat and thinking you can win games

AD and lebron (to a lesser extent w return from injury) just have to be wrecking balls down the stretch. The role players are far too inconsistent to cover for games where AD shoots 8 times. This aggression is on both the staff and AD (and Bron). There‚Äôs no reason these 2 shouldn‚Äôt be in the top 3 of attempted FGs a game. The excuse can‚Äôt be ‚Äúwell they got schemed out‚Äù. Top players don‚Äôt get schemed out. Enough of that. 

Finally, competitive spirit. It‚Äôs been a staple post deadline for this group to be flat. Yes, you can‚Äôt play a game 7 every game and you‚Äôre gonna lose games along the way, but I can‚Äôt stand this cadence of once every 3-4 games everyone looks like they‚Äôre sleepwalking / wants to try and turn it on late. Again, enough is enough of that. This isn‚Äôt November and no more post game losses by the staff / players saying ‚Äúwe‚Äôll be better‚Äù. The time to be better is right now.

Finally the X factor: rotations. Faster adjustments on the fly plz. I get giving Lonnie a look, but in no case do I get giving Malik + Lonnie a look TOGETHER, even with dlo out. This staff has certainly cost us games but, again, we aren‚Äôt in December anymore.

This is all frustrating because the requisite talent is there. Please just be better.",1.0
