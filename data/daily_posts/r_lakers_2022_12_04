4,2022-12-05 05:59:03,zcyltl,Y‚Äôall think Kuzma‚Äôs defense was good enough to be considered a trade target??,LeSchmuk3,"I mean.. just from what I saw.. he has definitely matured in some regards (went at AD 2x in a row, one time bumping him in the chest and going for the lay in)

He‚Äôs good around the rim, jumper seemed streaky, but he had to do a lot without Beal. 

Made the same good ollll Kuz mistakes like moving screens, some sloppy play, but would he play well in our scheme?? 

Way better than Bev.. I know that.. and we can extend him, I think he‚Äôs def worth a 2nd",1.0

8,2022-12-05 05:19:39,zcxutn,The Wizards have some nice trade pieces that the Lakers should pursue if they become available.,blacPanther55,I think the perfect trade is to keep Pat Bev and to trade Nunn and Damian jones for Avdija and Gafford.  Kuz would be nice but Avdija seems like a big defensive wing and Gafford looks like an upgrade compared to jones.  I would not mind getting Kispert as well if he is available.,1.0

10,2022-12-05 05:10:49,zcxonv,The perfect trade I haven‚Äôt seen mentioned: pat bev and the 2027 first for kuzma,jackaldude25,"For the Lakers, I think this would be the perfect trade to boost the team into serious contention. Kuzma already obviously has championship experience and chemistry with Lebron and AD. He‚Äôs a big wing who can shoot, defend, and get you a bucket. I think our biggest hole on the roster is at the 4, and he seems like the perfect 4 to slot in next to Schroeder, Lonnie, bron, and AD in the starting lineup. 

On the Wizards side, this trade is assuming they want to be sellers at the deadline and lean into the tank. They are at very best a 9 or 10 seed in the competitive eastern conference, and if they DO make the playoffs, then they lose their draft pick this year. They  only keep their pick if they‚Äôre in the lottery. Given the direction of the franchise I think most would agree to embrace the tank and try for an chance at Wemby. 

What do y‚Äôall think? Does it seem possible, or do you think that package isn‚Äôt good enough to get kuzma?",1.0

He has good chemistry with our roleplayers like Wenyen, Thomas, and Lonnie. If he gets traded we lose a playmaker and some our roleplayers might get worse. Do we really trust Dennis to be the main ball handler when lebron sits? Might be better off trading Bev and Nunn for some shooters. Or at the very least getting another ball handler if we trade Russ",1.0

if you can even have the argument whether your best player is a PER monster who is currently on an MVP streak OR a player in literal GOAT debates who is currently putting up historical numbers at his age, i‚Äôd say our team in is a pretty good spot

In past, if Russell Westbrook is sitting on 6 points, he might force the fuck out of anything just to get 15-20 points, even to the detriment of his own team, if I'm being honest.    

But tonight, he wasn't feeling his shot, while almost everyone else was, and he deferred with confidence.    

I'm so proud of him, for being able to adapt.   This team has goals that transcend everything, far beyond Russ, AD and even LeBron.  After the fact, that's when they get their lauds.",1.0

Kendrick Nunn and Damian Jones plus a first and a second for Jakob Poeltl  

These two trades address two of our most significant needs right now. I good big wing that can shoot and defend, and an excellent defensive big. Plus, they are both young, so if you extend them right after the trades, you can recoup value in the future if needed.

I know these trades are easier said than done since the Spurs hate us and the Wizards might just want to keep Kuzma for all we know. But I think the front office needs to go hard after these two players with all their pick assets. 

Starting lineup:

Dennis, Lonnie, Kuzma, Lebron, AD

Russ, Reaves, Troy, Jacob, Wenyen, Christie, Bryant

67,2022-12-04 15:25:50,zcchsf,I really hope we do not trade Patrick Beverley,Nathan185,"I'm sure we as sports fan should know not to base a player with a long stretch of work off of a 20-game sample size, especially when it is on a new team. Beverley has a really good track record of improving teams on both ends of the floor when he plays, and his impact on the Wolves last year was no joke, by the stats or the eye test, which is why Wolves fans still love him so much.

Pat Bev is a really good role player and already a great defender. If we trade him and he starts shooting 38% from 3 for whatever team he gets traded too, I **guarantee** everyone on the sub is going to complain why we ""give up on our role players too quickly"" just like KCP and Kuzma. I remember Lakers fans were shitting on Caruso too after the 2021 series against the Suns, but now all everyone talks about is why we let him go.",1.0

70,2022-12-04 13:37:44,zc9zpn,Does AD really weight 10lbs more than giannis?,Nice_Complaint_2602,"AD weights 253lbs according to [https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/d/davisan02.html](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/d/davisan02.html) and Giannis weighs 240lbs [https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/a/antetgi01.html](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/a/antetgi01.html). 

I don't know if the weights are up to date or how the players were weighed since weight can fluctuate quite a bit throughout the day or day to day depending on what's in the GI food tract and water retention. 

Assuming they're accurate, I have a hard time seeing how Giannis doesn't weigh 10-20lbs more than AD. Giannis is the same height or slightly taller and visibly looks a lot more muscular. 

Interestingly, KD is also 240lbs according to [https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/d/duranke01.html](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/d/duranke01.html).",1.0
