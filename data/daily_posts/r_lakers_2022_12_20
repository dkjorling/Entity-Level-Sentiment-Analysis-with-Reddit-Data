Over the past few weeks, there‚Äôs been a palpable feeling across various parts of the franchise of a disconnect over LaVine‚Äôs situation in Chicago",HeroGolem3,"Excerpts:

&gt; The Bulls have held multiple team meetings to try to work out their issues, and that has included one-on-one, face-to-face sitdowns between DeRozan and LaVine, multiple sources with direct knowledge who were granted anonymity because they are unauthorized to speak publicly on the matter have told The Athletic. DeRozan and LaVine have always had a strong mutual respect for each other. Only 10 months ago, over All-Star Weekend in Cleveland, the stars proclaimed themselves as the NBA‚Äôs best duo. They maintain a good personal relationship. But their meetings have not led to in-game results so far, with a level of on-court, stylistic tension simply festering throughout the season and being magnified due to the win-loss record.

&gt; Multiple league sources and sources close to the organization say LaVine and the Bulls are not seeing eye-to-eye. Over the past few weeks, there‚Äôs been a palpable feeling across various parts of the franchise of a disconnect over LaVine‚Äôs situation in Chicago

&gt; DeRozan joined the Bulls on a three-year, $85 million deal in 2021 and will be eligible for an extension this summer worth a maximum of four years and $153.7 million. Do the Bulls view DeRozan as a centerpiece for years to come?

If you are a fan I think it‚Äôs worthwhile to understand that our team has some of the best players in the league, they are continuously getting better, and they are holding themselves accountable. I get that sometime when you see back to back Ls you can get discouraged but don‚Äôt give up so easily. All I see when I look at the lakers is a team that has a high ceiling but a complicated chemistry issue that has slowly been getting better. Westbrook has made a huge shift in his play and he‚Äôs doing well with it, Ad Is embracing the responsibilities of a centre, younger players are starting to key in to their roles. Most of all, you can see that they are determined to win and taking this season seriously. Whatever happens, imma keep having faith in this team because I don‚Äôt feel cheated by their effort.",1.0

They play game with fast pace, Fox averages 30 against our backcourt players, Sabonis has scored 20/20 more than anyone in this league for this season. We have no answer to stop him when we don't have AD as our primary defender. 

Davion Mitchell, Kevin heurter are also the threats for our crippled defense due to the injury.

we should've played against injured Suns, and I know it was a back to back and Lebron Russ pat are all old, but this was our chance to redeem some of our brutal losses like against celtics pacers etc.",1.0
