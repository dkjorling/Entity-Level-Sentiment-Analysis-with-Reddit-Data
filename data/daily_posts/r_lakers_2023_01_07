It seems we will be playing AD at the 4 upon his return. Do you think TB starts at the 5 or would you rather we target a big? If Turner isn‚Äôt available I‚Äôm not sure anyone better can start at the 5.

Same record as the Celtics when they started their turnaround last year.,TradeWestbrick,"The Celtics traded a bunch of negative players clogging up their rotation for Derrick White and Daniel Theis and had one of the biggest turnarounds in NBA history that ended in a finals berth.

Literally all it takes is a move or two but our FO is more concerned with dodging the repeater tax than trying to compete. If we punt this season we let 65+ million in expiring contracts go to waste and are going to struggle to rebuild with just 30 million in cap next year. The AD and LeBron era might as well be over.


The West is wide open this year. 0 doubt in my mind we'd be a top 3 seed if we just did the Indiana deal before the season.
