With around 9-10 games left, i will include teams from 4th seed (2.5 games ahead of us) all the way to 12th (0.5 games behind us).

1) Suns: are 2.5 games ahead of us and have a 2-1 lead in h2h but if we win the match later on we'll be tied and it'll depend on conference. Suns are 24-19 and we are 21-24. So unlikely but its possible.


2) Clippers: 2.5 games behind and we dont have the tiebreaks.


3) Warriors: 1.5 games ahead of us and we have the tiebreaks.


4) Timberwolves: 0.5 games behind and we dont have the tiebreaks 


5) Mavs: tied and we dont have the tiebreaks 


6) Pelicans: tied and we have the tiebreaks 


7) OKC: tied and 1-1 on h2h so tomorrow's game will decide tiebreaks 


8) Utah: 0.5 behind us and 0-2 in h2h. We need to win our next 2 h2h games then it'll depend on conference. Utah are 22-23 and we are 21-24.",1.0

I am sure plenty of stans will pick LeBron and thats fine, hard to argue with arguably the best or 2nd best player ever. And when AD is physically and mentally sound, he is a top 5 player in the league, if not top 2 or 3.

But for me, I love DLo and Reaves. Both play hard and play well. Sure some deficiencies, off-shooting nights, defensive issues, whatever, but I always root for guys who play hard night in and night out and maybe arent the superstar everyone is expecting and paying to see.

Glad to have DLo back, he is mature, and perfect for us. and Reaves is playing out of his mind, I love to see it.

Who are your faves?

39,2023-03-23 15:29:17,11znu2t,The Vanderbilt Dilemma,Chao_607,"Anthony Davis and Devin Booker struggled in the first half yesterday before going off in the third quarter. 

AD in the first half: 7 pts on 3/6 FG.

Booker in the first half: 8 pts on 3/6 FG.

AD in the third quarter: 14 pts on 6/10 FG.

Booker in the third quarter: 14 pts on 5/6 FG. 

What happened in the third quarter? With 6 minutes left in the third quarter, Vando picked up his fourth foul, and was subbed in place of Beasley. In the six minutes Vando was playing, AD was 2/4 from the field, scoring 4 more points. Booker only shot the ball once. After Vando went to the bench, AD would go 4/6 dropping 10 points in 6 minutes, and Booker would go 4/5 dropping 9 points in those 6 minutes. This is the Vanderbilt dilemma. He is one of the best defenders in the NBA, the stats and eye test both show that he had Booker in jail for the first half. Unfortunately, he also does not space the floor, leading to the Suns doubling AD, causing him to struggle offensively. 

Vanderbilt's offensive struggles are not due to a lack of effort. He went 5/5 from the field and 3/3 from the free throw line last night, which is a huge part of why we won. However, teams will bet that he won't maintain this consistency and continue to clog the paint, causing future problems for AD, and the reason for rough week.

Personally, my basketball philosophy tends to favor defense over offense, so I wouldn't advocate dropping Vando out of the starting lineup or limiting his minutes. We actually lost the third quarter by 4 points (partially due to Wenyen's six point swing), as AD's offensive explosion was mostly nullified by Booker's offensive explosion. I think/hope that LeBron's return will solve this dilemma, as Vanderbilt is a really good cutter, which LeBron will exploit with his cutting. Vando is a great lob threat too, as we saw at the end of the game. However, the pessimist in me also sees the possibility that LeBron's return makes things worse, as he is shooting 30% from 3 this year, creating even more traffic in the paint between him, Vando, and AD.",1.0

Hopefully Ham does the same strategy with SGA. OKC goes as SGA goes, and disrupting him will be the key to getting a win. We need the same level of urgency that we had in PHX.
