Hello you all.

I am visiting SF from India and I'm a huge Lakers fan. I wanted to catch the game in Sacramento tomorrow since LA is too far for me, and I don't know where to find if there are buses or trains coming back to SF in the night post 10 PM. Would any of you happen to know best modes of travel back? Any leads would be appreciated. Thanks.",1.0
