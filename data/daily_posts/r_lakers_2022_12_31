8,2022-12-31 15:06:38,zzw16v,Why isnâ€™t anyone talking about how good Russ and Lebron have looked when sharing minutes lately?,Freeeecurry,"Last night, all I saw spammed in the game chat was how the closing lineup lacked shooting. 

Damned if you do, and damned if you donâ€™t huh if youâ€™re ham? 

We saw Lebron single-handedly deliver us that victory and although Russ had an overall average to good game his layup and steal on Dejounte Murray in the clutch were huge.

However one overlooked part was how Russ was sent out there to make the Lebron takeover easier as heâ€™s the only ball handler on this team capable of both handling the ball and getting it to Lebron no matter where his positioning is on the court, and thatâ€™s exactly what happened last night. Russ went out there and got Lebron the ball, in the spots Lebron wanted it and that added chemistry has not only proven effective thus far but disproven that Russ and Bron canâ€™t share the court

Lebrons off ball play has been phenomenal and efficient, and Russ has done great finding Lebron in less effective defensive schemes

Often to start games Lebron is forced to iso and take less efficient shots because of the lack of a real playmaker. 

And to all you echo chambering the playoffs narrative, no team can guard rotations where you have 48 minutes of Lebron-Ad Lebron-Russ and Russ-Ad because youâ€™ll always have Lebron and Russ there to break down defenses as they have been.",1.0

14,2022-12-31 08:31:02,zzpf5j,Trust these two a lot more than I trust Damian Jones,an4lf15ter,Think we should trade for a big rather than a wing. Our first priority should be a rim protecting center who could maybe stretch the floor a little bit. Getting a Center like that would allow Thomas Bryant to be our backup 5 and dominate against other bench bigs. We would also see more minutes for Lebron at the 3 allowing quality starting wing minutes.,1.0
