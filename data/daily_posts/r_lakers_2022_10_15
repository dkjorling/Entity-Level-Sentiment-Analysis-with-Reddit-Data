I for one am excited to follow a team that I really don‚Äôt have expectations for this year. They aren‚Äôt capable of letting me down in the way that the Dodgers just did. I just hope they are more competent this season and stay reasonably healthy.

I don‚Äôt know what the point of this is other than to give those of us who are Dodger/Laker fans a place to be sad together without having to deal with the shit show that is r/dodgers now.",0.89

In short, what the hell is happening? I was optimistic about last night since Russ was finally coming off the bench. Is it just our issue of having too many guards is killing us? Nunn and Walker not hitting shots? I thought our defense looked decent in spurts in a few of the preseason games, is our defense just ass now too? Lol 

Can someone give me a TLDR of the game last night and why we apparently looked so ass, even with Russ coming off the bench?",0.5

Since Russ can't seem to be a starter who gives Ham the disciplined-energy that the team needs defensively --what if Russ pulls a Rondo? And embraces the 2nd unit greatly? So greatly, to whereas when they enter the game...his *triple-double style* is now a delight!

*What say you?* Is it possible we can see the Lakers' 2nd unit resemble 2020-'21 Washington Wizards' offense? Russ did take sorcery's squad to the playoffs by finishing the season 17-7 and won the play-in too.",0.28
