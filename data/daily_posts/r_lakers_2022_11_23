any team is going to demand 1st Rd picks to absorb Westbrook massive contract...the concept of building his value for a trade is delusional...Westbrook is a mid-level exception bench player now...that is where a team will engage him as a viable option...not at 47 million dollars

the irony is his next team will get Westbrook @ his true value...and get the full benefits of his strengths w/o having to swallow all the downside...",1.0

It's been a down year for our boys in purple and gold and it's been a down couple of years for me and my wife as well. Recently we have experienced a host of economic issues and most days we are tasked with making difficult decisions about what bills to pay and what bills to not pay. I have found myself even skipping lunch at work to use the money for gas instead. Overall it has not been a championship season for us. But we are happy and chipping away at it. My wife however has grown restless, she is a stay at home mom at the moment and recently decided she wanted to chip in and help. I encouraged her to pursue her dream of starting a business and with my last $150 I bought a domain, built a [squarespace](www.moneymombrand.com) site and helped her manufacture 8 shirts from her original design. They look nice and the site is live! I am very proud of her for not only wanting to pursue her dream but also because it's coming from a place of support. She wants to help our situation and frankly I couldn't be more in love with her.

I am hoping this is allowed but maybe the Lakers nation can rise up and give our Instagram a follow? Check out the site and give us some feedback? Either way I hope our season turns around and maybe in a couple of months our lives will turn around too.

Oh and I reached out to Russell Westbrook and his honorthegift brand but no response just yet, I'd love to pick his brain about fashion and clothing brands.",1.0

He averaging 19 10 3 Dimes and 4 Swats a game. 
He has also bulked up a little bit from last yr his body while not shredded does look a lil bit stronger and more agile to guard bigs. 

He is also capable of shooting the 3 ball.
Legit defender and rim runner be got volley ball put back skills. Obviously he is in the g league. But after seeing how Damian Jones has disappointed. And how AD lamented over the days he had bigs like Javale and Dwight to give him room to roam and play his game. Its worth a shot even if its jus a 10 day. 

Personally I would do this sign him to a 2 way see if it makes a difference this time. At this point it couldn‚Äôt hurt.

Lakers would get Terry Rozier who is already signed for long term so no need to worry about resigning him in the off-season...Rozier fits perfectly alongside Lebron &amp; AD as an explosive scoring guard similar to Kyrie or Bradley Beal but better defender... @ half the salary of what Kyrie or Bradley Beal would demand for long term commitment... Bogdanovic is also signed under contract for multiples years...these two guys are high level starters who would not be half season rentals like a Myles Turner could possibly be...or on a bloated contract like Buddy Hield...the way I would structure the deal is a 4 for 4 trade...Lakers give up their 4 worst contracts and pickup 4 players that will fill all the holes in the roster...

Lakers get: Terry Rozier, Bojan Bogdanovic, Mason Plumlee, Alec Burks...

Hornets get: 27' 1st, Pat Bev, Nunn, Nerlens Noel [from pistons]

Pistons get: 29' 1st, Westbrook, Damion Jones...

they great thing about this trade is every team has major incentives to make a deal happen...Hornets and Pistons are already out of playoff contention and are looking to position themselves favorably for the Wembanyama sweepstakes...both teams have incentives to start shedding long term salary and veteran contracts for future draft picks...Terry Rozier is on year 1 of his 4 year extension... which means a team would have to commit long term cap space to acquire him plus give up draft compensation... that is alot of commitment to give for a 6'2 guard...how many contending teams are willing to do that... Bogdanovic just signed an extension...Pistons are going nowhere and are building for the future...so any team willing to offer a 1st Rd. Pick could easily acquire him... Burks and Plumlee are very good veteran players on expiring deals...Lakers could maybe throw in a few 2nd Rd. picks to acquire those two in the deal as well... no waiting on mystery ""superstars"" to suddenly demand to be traded to the Lakers...no need for wild speculation or conspiracy trade theories from anonymous GMs...we are talking very talented veterans from teams who are already tanking... 4 players that transform this team to true contenders...maybe title favorites...best part is this trade proposal can be completed after Dec. 15th...3 weeks away...this proposed trade gives the Lakers roster everything its missing...size to complement AD...  dynamic perimeter  scoring/shooting...big wing players...bench depth...Terry Rozier is the perfect #3 to compliment Lebron &amp; AD...he would excel as the lead guard flanked by two mega stars...I would even give Rozier Westbrook's #0 jersey...the new &amp; improved 360 trio... 

importing this level of talent while at the same time you shed all the bloated contracts and dead weight holding this roster back from being what it could be...this is the deal Rob Pelinka should be pursuing...Pistons-Hornets would have tangible incentive to work with the Lakers to get a deal done...did I mention that this deal would cut 7.5 million off the top of the Lakers total payroll ...saving Jeanie Buss over 30 MILLION in luxury taxes...WHAT THE HELL IS PELINKA WAITING FOR...#makethetradepelinka",1.0

‚ÄúImprove the team drastically before Christmas or I will request a trade‚Äù

AD is playing like the modern day Wilt, LeBron is the best 38 year old player ever and is a top 15 player in the league. 

There are trades that can improve this team and capitalize on this goated duo. 

I think AD should force Pelinka to make the trade. 

A starting lineup of Walker IV, Hield, Bron, AD and Turner can run with anyone in the league. It‚Äôs a crazy offensive lineup with 2 solid rim protectors. 

Trade Nunn, Pat Bev along with 2 rounders for a quality rotation player and you got a nice bench of Reaves, TBJ, Bryant, Shroeder and Josh Richardson for example. 

This team can compete for the 3-4th spot in the West and this is enough for LBJ and AD to make a deep playoff run. 

Who are we scared of with the new squad?

Suns pee their bad every year in the playoffs unless their opponent gets an injury. 

Mavericks are not really a threat, Warriors are struggling. 

Blazers, Nuggets or Clippers? 

These teams have proven that they can‚Äôt win when it matters and Dame and Kawhi are always unavailable. 

There is a window this year and we got 2 superstars.",0.43
82,2022-11-23 08:29:17,z2jp8i,Buddy Hield and Myles Turner are not what this team needs.,BrianC_,"People need to take a realistic look at this team right now.

With AD dominating, TB looking much better since returning, and Wenyen being a capable hustle player, they have 48 minutes of solid center production.

With LeBron returning and being predominantly a 4 these days, that's a lot of your 4/5 minutes covered.

With Reaves and Walker IV playing exceptionally well, they have the role of SG covered.  Splitting 48 minutes of 2-guard production between them with a bit of spillover to the 3 is fine.  Even if you need 3pt shooting volume, it shouldn't come at their expense.

Those parts of the team are fine.

Where are the holes on this team?

With the way Beverley is playing on offense, he's nearing the point of being unplayable yet covers almost 30 mpg.

If the team trades Westbrook, with Nunn and Schroder playing the way they are and no reasonable expectation they'll change drastically, they'll need a bench play-maker that can lead and stabilize the 2nd unit.

While TBJ has been good for a minimum level player, it's very clear that with LeBron being predominantly a 4 these days that they need more quality and depth at the 3.

Because Reaves and Walker IV are fine at the 2 and Beverley is so painfully under-performing, it's quite obvious that the team needs a volume 3pt shooting PG with at least neutral PoA defense.

And, because the team's center rotation is fine, LeBron is predominantly a 4, and TBJ, while good as a minimum, isn't enough at the 3, they need a 3/4 combo forward that is a volume 3pt shooter and capable perimeter defender.

Lastly, if the team trades Westbrook to get those pieces, they'll also need a quality back-up play-maker to lead the 2nd unit.  If the team is left with Nunn and Schroder as their 2nd-unit play-makers, that's a disaster.

Do Turner and Hield fill those needs?

Hield straight up does not.  He fills a need in terms of shooting but doesn't fill the team's needs defensively or in terms of play-making (even though I do think Hield is an underrated play-maker, he's at best a secondary one).

Turner addresses some issues by pushing AD to the 4 and LeBron to the 3 thus sizing up and lessening the need for SF minutes.  But, while AD might be more comfortable as a mobile big on defense, LeBron is not as a wing-stopper nor should he have to expend that type of energy defensively while still needing to excel on offense.  The team is still left very thin in terms of wing 3pt shooting and defense and Turner doesn't really fix that.

Overall, there would still be major holes on this team even after such a trade.  Would they be better?  Probably.  Would they be a contender?  I'm not sure.

Now, is there a trade currently out there that actually directly fills all the needs we have?  No.  Not that I've seen.

But, is there a need to rush into an imperfect trade?  No.  This is their only chance at getting it right and if they want to contend, they have to.  If this team cannot stay afloat without Hield and Turner, there is no point to having them.",0.38

Recently we have experienced a host of economic issues and most days we are tasked with making difficult decisions about what bills to pay and what bills to not pay. I have found myself even skipping lunch at work to use the money for gas instead. Overall it has not been a championship season for us. But we are happy and chipping away at it. My wife however has grown restless, she is a stay at home mom at the moment and recently decided she wanted to chip in and help. I encouraged her to pursue her dream of starting a business and with my last $150 I bought a domain, built a [square space site](www.moneymombrand.com) and helped her manufacture 8 shirts from her original design. They look nice and the site is live! I am very proud of her for not only wanting to pursue her dream but also because it's coming from a place of support. She wants to help our situation and frankly I couldn't be more in love with her.

I am hoping this is allowed but maybe the Lakers nation can rise up and give our [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/moneymombrand/) a follow? Check out the site and give us some feedback? Either way I hope our season turns around and maybe in a couple of months our lives will turn around too.

Oh and I reached out to Russell Westbrook and his honorthegift brand but no response just yet, I'd love to pick his brain about fashion and clothing brands.",1.0
