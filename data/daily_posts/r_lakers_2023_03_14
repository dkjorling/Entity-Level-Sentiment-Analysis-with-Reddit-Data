Wenyen Gabriel is not even a real big, heâ€™s really a skinny SF. Trotting him out there as our only small big with no real backup big is playing with fire.

Should Rob go sign an actual big to a 10-day? 

Some free agent bigs: 

- Hassan Whiteside

- Serge Ibaka

- Tristan Thompson 

- Demarcus Cousins

- Moses Brown

- Vernon Carey",1.0

Don't you dare tell me Wenyen and don't you dare get me started with Vanderbilt as center. Who the hell will play center in a Houston team that is 36.2 in contested reb%. Who? (Where's our center or are we just going small ball 3 guard lineup and get high on the Darvin train?) \[Don't get me wrong I think we can run them as ""center"" but it just doesn't feel right and it seems we'd get bullied\]",1.0
6,2023-03-15 04:34:06,11rm50h,Key to tomorrows Houston game: Rui,suhar97,"Iâ€™m personally looking for a big Rui game tomorrow. AD being out means there will be significant usage to absorb. While intuition initially suggests thatâ€™ll go to Austin, Dennis, and Dlo, I think Rui should be in the mix and is the x-factor for this team tomorrow and moving forward.

I would love to see a rui masterclass where he explodes for 25 points or something, but his size, length, and athleticism will be critical on both ends tomorrow.

The lakers should ALWAYS have 2 of Rui Vando and Wenyen on the floor to offset the size disparity to a degree. 

Who is your X factor in tomorrows game? 

Bonus: additional X factor will be turnovers. Havenâ€™t checked stats but this has felt like a consistent issue since the deadline.",1.0

I'm so confused. There are so many serviceable bigs out there that can play and we didn't plan ahead for this?!?!

Yes maybe we can beat the Rockets without an extra big, but just to have the option is a crucial mistake in my opinion. Keep in mind these Rockets beat the Celtics just recently and are top 5 in rebounding.",1.0
