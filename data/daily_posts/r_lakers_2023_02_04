Hesitant. Miami? Hesitant. Clippers? Hesitant. If every single team is hesitant to offer Kyrie a long term max contract, that just goes to show that more negotiations will be made, not that the deal is in the water. Obviously, I want this deal to get done, but there is a glimmer of hope since this hesitancy is consistent with every single team in the league.

We should instead want to build out the roster better with a big to pair alongside AD and another wing player at least. 

The Nets beat Wizards, with Sumner, Claxton, and Cam Thomas pulling through. The Clippers have Mann, Kennard, Batum, Powell, Morris, RoCo, Wall, Reggie. 

We need to build out this roster with depth, focused on defensive talent because that’s what won us the championship.

He’s a top 3 iso scorer in the game and does it with so much efficiency and grace.

Him and LeBron are a proven fit. Kyrie has never ever closely played with someone like AD. I know we spam the Bron/AD pick and roll but could you imagine a Kyrie / AD pick and pop?

I honestly cannot believe folks are hesitant to include AR-15. He’s a fan favorite but his ceiling is a quality starter. If y’all think he’s a 3rd option or even 4th on a championship team y’all are delusional. 

The Nets have WAY more leverage than you think. Kyrie wants a max deal and that seems non negotiable. The dude already lost like 20m refusing to get the jab so don’t expect a discount. We cannot get him anywhere close to max money. The only teams with actual cap space to sign Kyrie outright are garbage non contending teams. 

The Nets sign and trade is the only way to acquire him and so if they decide they will play hardball they could fuck everything up.

If Reaves OR Max are being the held up Rob P and Jeanie are clueless. We don’t even play Max many games. 

If the trade is Kyrie / Harris for EITHER Reaves or Max, Westbrook, 27, 29 first.

91,2023-02-04 14:02:50,10th3un,seriously why the hell BKN should trade with us?,Trent_Bennett,"Leaving here a thought. The Kyrie drama is all but to risolve in a week or two span. Kd did the same and at the end of the day he did remain and signed and extension.

Ky maybe wants himself out of there, but still we have nothing, but nothing useful compared to other potential acquires.

Our only leverage is he can still resign with us in summer with his bird rights, but assuming BKN won't give us a favor and let him walk for nothing in FA, we won't be able to do that.

That's a really tough scenario, considering Rui is a gem and we can't loose him for Ky only, he's our only young and decent wing.

What realistically the Lakers should do, counting on the fact our FO/Ownership is one of the cheapest ever and won't go in super tax for nothing in the world. They are so blind and cheap if someone would offer in a trade prime Shaq at 50M/year they would still refuse bc ""hard tax""",1.0

I feel like this is an instance where our fandom love for a player is greater than their actual basketball output.",1.0
