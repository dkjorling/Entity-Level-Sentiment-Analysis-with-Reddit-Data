Kuzma had low IQ plays that made me so mad just like Westbrook does last 2 seasons, just much less frequent than Russ. With Rui it's not that case, even when he screws up I can't be mad because it was good basketball idea and not some low iq play or shot. 

Still waiting more to judge his defense but he isn't looking as bad as some Wizards fans said",1.0

Let‚Äôs be honest, even with let‚Äôs say you get Hield and Turner. How is that an assurance that they can get a title? If AD comes back and is healthy then maybe? But even then, do they see them spending the rest of their remaining years with the Lakers or just leave after a year or two? Plus Lebron has 2-3 years left probably. Is burning those 2 picks really worth it? Like remember when we literally cant draft people because we don‚Äôt have picks? We only became relevant again when Lebron signed. I dont see AD being a centerpiece when Lebron retires. Like I don‚Äôt see him carrying the Lakers. Westbrook is there because the FO scorched the entire roster and traded all our pieces (that was #1 defense that year) for someone they literally targeted on defense during their last championship run and let‚Äôs be honest because Lebron wanted him. 

Correcting a mistake with a big gamble isn‚Äôt good business. To me either trade Russ and probably some players to contend or keep Russ and hope they figure it out and be healthy. But don‚Äôt touch those picks. 

IF they touch those picks may it be towards a talent that actually can be a centerpiece for a long time and not just leave when things are bad.",1.0

Trade 2027 unprotected pick protected for Gary and Fred, Max would have to go to sweeten the deal.

Trade 2029 protected for Bojan 

The Lakers won the title with shooters like KCP/ Green/ Morris/ Kuzma even Rondo was knocking threes

We already know Gary and Bojan are good at that already and Fred is a streaky shooter too that controls the pace and has won a championship before. 2023 and 2024 there are no star free agents, It is in 2025 that players like Tatum, Ingram will be free agents, you can sign players next year to two-year contracts and Fred and Gary could be signed for that. I would do this trade because you can have a line up of AD, JAMES, BOJAN, TRENT, FRED to close out games and you have shooters everywhere for Lebron and AD to operate in the clutch. Being that the Raptors are not contending and can lose them for nothing I would take a hard look at themselves because they wont be able to sign OG if they keep Fred and Gary. Russ has proven that he won't fit and its time for Rob to pull the trigger on a mistake he made.",1.0
