Hypothetical but curious because Suns play Nuggets, us and Clippers. If we beat Clippers, then they'd try to win their last 2 to try and avoid the play in. With Warriors playing vs Kings and Blazers it'd be fun",1.0

You all know he wants to be in LA and Bron is his boy seemingly so I can‚Äôt imagine he wants to stay in Dallas of all places. We all know Ky wants to in LA, but a lot has changed in the past two months so I thought I‚Äôd pose the question: do we still want to go after Kyrie in the off-season, or are we good with DLO? 

I assume that as a fanbase we‚Äôve cooled on Kyrie coming here, but I‚Äôd still like to hear your thoughts‚Ä¶

For what it‚Äôs worth I personally am happy with Dlo (as long as he‚Äôs healthy) and don‚Äôt think Kyrie is worth it, but where do y‚Äôall stand?",1.0

If the Lakers want to lock up the 5-6th seeding then they need to play tomorrow, especially since they‚Äôll likely lose to the Suns the following game. Then they‚Äôll have another tough game against the Jazz to end the season. Why wouldn‚Äôt you try and capitalise on a hurt Clippers squad and hopefully push them or GS into the play-in? Pelicans could very well push the Clippers into a matchup with Minnesota which they could very much lose. Just doesn‚Äôt make sense to ‚Äúavoid‚Äù something that isn‚Äôt there.
