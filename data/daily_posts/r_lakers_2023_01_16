36,2023-01-16 16:15:22,10dike9,Timeout vs No Timeout debacle.,Early-Candidate5492,"In today's game of basketball I'm indifferent on it and imo it all depends on the team.

There's only a few teams I'm comfortable with letting whatever happens happens. Golden State  Brooklyn Miami Chicago.

There's atleast 1 common theme with the teams I mentioned they either have set closing groups or they have professional shot makers. In the case of Golden State they flourish in chaos and they move without the ball so that throws defenses in a bind.

The other teams I mentioned have professional tough shot makers KD Kyrie Jimmy Derozan. They can get to THEIR spot on the floor and get off the shot they want at all times.

The problem I have with the decision making with Darvin is that there's no plan. If you don't wanna use a timeout cool call out a set off the rebound. Or at the very least have a organized plan or rules you imply off of that scenario.

Why wasn't the spacing rules implied with 2 in the corner 1 in the dunker 2 at top. You could have called a simple dribble handoff where Russ hands the ball off to Lebron Wenyen sprints to the top Lebron goes down hill.",1.0

40,2023-01-16 14:37:27,10dg3xz,Earlier this season Darvin Ham called a timeout in between the free throws of his own player. His complete lack of awareness to why and how timeout are used is telling that he is in over his head.,CutLonzosHair2017,"Everyone watched the Philly game. But this isn't a minor issue. The type of mistakes he's making with timeouts is they type of mistakes a rec coach would make.

The timeout from the title showed such a lack of awareness about coaching but it has not been the only one. He also ran 5 minutes of game clock one game with AD at the scorers table waiting to check in without calling a time out. The other team went on a massive run and because he did not call a time out, AD played 2 minutes in the second quarter. And that was not purposeful as AD was waiting to check in for 5 minutes...

This is not me trying to bury Ham off of one incident. He's been bad all season. The 5 guard lineup. Having Westbrook and LeBron sit while PatBev played PG every 3rd quarter for the first 10ish games. Out of timeout plays routinely ending in a contested 3 for bad 3 point shooters. 

Vogel wasn't perfect. And there were hints that he had lost the locker room. But replacing him with an unknown was a mistake. And it was the same mistake that the Lakers made with Luke Walton.",1.0
41,2023-01-16 14:16:30,10dfmpp,Prediction for rest of the season,ThunderClown101,"The Lakers are 19-24 and are in the start of the toughest schedule part. 

It‚Äôs the worst time of the year to be missing 4 main rotation players‚Ä¶ 

If Reaves, Walker, AD and Beverly don‚Äôt come back soon things look very grim for the Lakers.

Tomorrow is Houston - it‚Äôs fine, but after that the schedule is incredibly tough‚Ä¶

Kings, Grizzlies, Blazers, Clippers in a 6 days stretch. 

They way this team is being coached it‚Äôs very hard to see them dominating any of these games if opposition is healthy. Meanwhile our coach has showed us that he is not capable of making smart decisions and adjustments to win close games.

And then we have an easy one in Spurs, after which we go on another tough run on the road. 

Celtics, Nets, Knicks, Pacers in 6 days as well. 

Let‚Äôs just imagine the Lakers go .500 against these teams and win 2 easy games against the Rockets and Spurs. 

They could end up with a 25-28 record with 29 games left in the season. 

However we should also consider the fact that LeBron will not play in every game, because there are 3 games in 4 nights twice and he is 38. 

Let‚Äôs assume he misses 2 games. 

My guess is that the Lakers are going to be 25-30 and will have 29 games to make the play-ins. 

They would need to go 17 and 12 to just finish at the .500 mark.

Hopefully they will be healthy for that final stretch of games, but nonetheless making a trade only makes sense to acquire quality role players to extend them this summer. 

Because if you make the trade to drastically improve the roster it‚Äôd be very difficult to go 17-12 with a brand new team. 

It‚Äôs seems that this season is on the verge of being completely lost. Best case scenario is making the play-in as 9-10 seeds which would require winning a lot of close games. Darvin Ham is a bad coach for this mission.

It would require a miracle run and lots of luck for the Lakers to get the 6-8 seeds. If that happens then there a chance that a healthy Lakers team can make some noise against young unproven teams like the Grizzlies or Pelicans in round 1.",1.0

45,2023-01-16 09:12:32,10d9zpg,Does anyone wonder if the coaching staff goes over games like this or just move too fast?,TorontoRaptors34,"IMO Ham and the rest off the staff have to solve this issue in practice as much as they get. This shit happened in the Indy, Boston, CHA, 

Despite controversial refs the last two games came down to a bucket and lack of prep. Good teams learn from there mistakes bad teams keep falling. Its good if you win and 2 of the wins on the win streak were close wins. However, I feel the staff has to learn and work with the players every practice what to do in clutch situations. They gotta be schematic and not revert to hero ball. When your dealing with older players you have to find other ways to dominate. You cannot rely on LeBron to bail you out anymore he's getting older and clearly while still great not as bullet proof as he was 5-10 yrs ago.

Practice makes perfect and something tells me this team doesn't practice nearly enough. Theres a lack of structure for a coach who preaches discipline. If you have a real system and plan guys will go out and execute. When you mess up in one game your job is to learn how to not repeat mistakes it isn't rocket science.",1.0
