Two fun and talented teams but lacking in experience and supremely flawed on one  end of the floor (Kings defensively and the Grizz offensively).

The 6th gets to matchup with the inexperienced Kings in the first round and either the Grizzlies or the 7th seed (with HCA) in the second round.

[Lineup data vs Grizzlies \(2\/28\)](https://preview.redd.it/1r0m3zuvfdla1.png?width=924&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=aeb27f9853fb2fa973c149f21b370bc6b60dfbb2)

Some things to note:

Despite seemingly going crazy from 3, Reaves seemed to struggle last game, playing a role in our bottom 5 lineups. This may have something to do with his 4 turnovers on the night. He has really struggled in lineups where he is the primary ball handler.

Walker had himself a game, but seems to do better when he is on the floor with Schroder rather than Reaves. 

All in all, a lot of noise in this dataset, Grizzlies had an insane third quarter which definitely fucks up the numbers.

&amp;#x200B;

[Lineup data vs OKC \(3\/1\)](https://preview.redd.it/9kxc5uq4hdla1.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=5b3ff8e0949f752f402eac77248f371925450666)

Hachimura and Schroder seem to be our two standout players here, being part of our three best lineups.

However, Hachimura was also a part of our two worst lineups so idk. I thought he had a good game overall by the eye test. Seems the lineup with Reaves-Walker-Christie-Rui-Gabriel just doesn't seem talented enough. I know we were short handed last night but that's not an NBA lineup. I think Christie has potential but he is frankly too raw for us at this point.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

There wasn't that much content for these last two games, so I decided to run +/- data for our players over the last five games. 

&amp;#x200B;

[One-man plus\/minus data](https://preview.redd.it/hb72rtk3idla1.png?width=284&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=e7dd3a216c9b89d19fd5ee42582fc936fb7ccc70)

Some things to note:

Our starting five is stellar, all five within the top six.

The only exception? Schroder. He has been excellent in Russell's absence. I feel that Russell's absence does not hurt the starting lineup due to Schroder being so good, but rather the bench because we have no ball handler for that group.

Austin Reaves seems to have had a rough couple games. I think his role over the last few games is the culprit. When Reaves replaces Beasley in the pseudo-starting lineup (Schroder-Reaves-Bron-Vando-AD), we are virtually the same. I think the problem is when Reaves runs with the bench crew without Schroder or LeBron, and is forced to be the primary ball handler.

To add on to my previous point, all the bench guys with the exception of Brown, who plays a lot of minutes with the starters (and started a few games), is in the negatives. This is a result of LeBron and Russell being out of the lineup, forcing Dennis away from the bench group, leaving Reaves as your only ball handler.

&amp;#x200B;

[Two-man plus\/minus data \(top 5 and bottom 5\)](https://preview.redd.it/ntyj41ywjdla1.png?width=486&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=9e7bd3a54df105c88bc89974c4cba8d10e2f60e9)

Since there were too many two-man combinations, I decided to just display the top 5 and bottom 5. If you guys would like to see specific pairings, let me know and I will respond. I also limited my scope to just our top ten rotation players, as I feel like that is what Ham will play in the playoffs. 

Vanderbilt and Davis have been excellent together, locking shit up defensively.

LeBron and Schroder have such great chemistry. I made a post earlier today talking about their work together in the bench lineup.

Vando and Beasley got that triple trade connection so their chemistry is already through the roof. 

&amp;#x200B;

Same thing with the two-man combinations, only included top ten rotation players, and top 5 and bottom 5 lineups.

Bron Vando Davis have been an insane front court, talked previously about how insane they are/could be defensively.

49,2023-03-02 08:05:24,11fx2ly,It's Title Time,threepointcheese,"Dear Laker Hopefuls:

In the history of modern title contention, here is where we stand. Since 1980 (43 years), teams to win the NBA championship with sub 50 wins are:

1. 1995 Rockets, sixth seed (47-35)
2. 2021 Bucks, third seed (46-26)\*
3. 1999 Spurs, first seed (36-13)\*
4. 2012 Heat, second seed (46-20)\*

\*shortened seasons, lock out.

Since 1980, teams to win the NBA championship with a number 1 option over the age of 35 are:

1. None

Only the 1995 Rockets have won a championship with sub 50 wins in a full 82 game season. No NBA team has won a championship with their best player over the age of 35. Given these two damning pieces of evidence, more damning still, the Lakers top three players are not and have not been healthy for the team. No NBA team has won a championship with injuries to their three best players. As LA natives, an intellectual fanbase who convinced only by empirical data to form our opinions, we can arrive at a singular conclusion: The Lakers are not winning another championship in the foreseeable future. All odds are against the Lakers. 

# FUCK. THAT. 

Here is what I see:

1. LeBron James is the greatest floor general in the history of the NBA.
2. LeBron James is the greatest floor general in the NBA today.
3. LeBron and AD are the best duo to play in the league since Shaq and Kobe.

After trading Russell Westbrook, the Lakers have won five out of seven games. Without laboring extensively over permutations and opponent quality, four of these games have been without LeBron James. Two of these games have been without Anthony Davis. 3.75 of these games have been without D'Angelo Russell. In this seven game stretch, Anthony Davis, LeBron James, and D'Angelo Russell have only played one full game together and handily defeated our short term rival, the New Orleans Pelicans, 120-102.

After watching this seven game stretch, here is where I'm at:

1. The Lakers if healthy have an elite lockdown perimeter defender (Jarred Vanderbilt)
2. The Lakers if healthy have an elite lockdown post defender (Anthony Davis)
3. The Lakers if healthy possess the best half court basketball player in the NBA (LeBron James)
4. The Lakers if healthy possess the best front court complement in the NBA (Anthony Davis)
5. The Lakers if healthy possess an 8 man rotation that can demolish or comeback against playoff level teams on any given night
6. The Lakers possess a team that can win against NBA talent without their three best players
7. The Lakers can win in the NBA when LeBron James has an off night

Given the most important factor, that the Lakers possess the ability to string together wins, shorthanded, post all star break, the Lakers, if healthy, are not only a playoff team, but they can also contend in the playoffs with the best teams in the NBA who are as follows: Bucks, Celtics, Sixers, Nuggets, Clippers, Warriors, Suns. No other team is a contender. The listed are the six best teams in the NBA for the historical logic:

1. These teams have won 50 plus games in an 82 game season, or
2. Their number one is a proven champion with multiple championships

Since 1980, only 4 teams in the NBA have won a singular championship. Any wet nosed nephew or casual sports fan can list those teams when pressed. They are the 2021 Bucks, 2011 Mavericks, 2007 Celtics, and 2004 Pistons.  In the last 43 years, 39 championships have been hoarded by number ones as follows: Stephen Curry (4), LeBron James (4), Kawhi Leonard (2), Kobe Bryant (5), Tim Duncan (5), Shaquille O'Neal (4), Michael Jordan (6), Isiah Thomas (2), Larry Bird (3), Magic Johnson (5), Dr. J (3). That is fucking it.

There are no other generational talents. That's fucking it. Those are your generational talents. I don't give a damn about what you think about players, teams, or luck. PG's latest interview articulated it in a round about way, every other superstar since 1980 was a tier two bitch who couldn't win it all and didn't have the self awareness to know it. You're worried about up and comers? Sack the FUCK up. The Celtics, Nuggets, and Sixers have to pull a CHRIST level miracle out their effing a\*\*holes to be a new winner. You're worried about the Clippers, Warriors, and Suns? These teams will not win 50 games in this 82 game season.

In this context, the Bucks are the favorites but have not had their second star. Moreover, the Bucks won when the teams with players with multiple championships were all out of contention due to injuries to the first or second best player on their team: Lakers, AD; Warriors, Klay; Clippers, Kawhi. The Bucks, if they win, solidify that Giannis is in the conversation of talent of the best of the best of all time, but until that happens, the Bucks championship was an outlier. THEREFORE:

No team in the NBA this year is a true contender. IT'S WIDE FUCKING OPEN FOR THE LAKERS BAEBEEEEEEEE. LeBron and AD are STILL the best one two punch after Shaq and Kobe, and they finally have a DEEP team who can win an NBA game without not only BOTH LeBron and AD :BUT ALSO THEIR THIRD STAR.

It's post fucking all star break, and the team is winning without their best players. If you're talking shit, shut the fuck up and stop criticizing the team, you pedantic d bag. At this point, any micromanaging means jack SHIT and you're just a HATER, NOT A FAN. Apologize to Darvin Ham. Apologize to Rob Pelinka. Fuck you, LeBron, get your 38 year old ass together and DO SOMETHING THE WORLD HAS NEVER SEEN.

NEPHEWS. RAISE YOUR HANDS. SUPPORT THE FUCKING TEAM. BANNERS UP, EIGHT FUCKING TEEN BAY BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

TLDR: Stop complaining, nerd. Get on the bandwagon, we're taking off without you. This is a historic season. Let's win the ship.",1.0
