Second, the Lakers were not willing to include Austin Reaves and/or rookie Max Christie in the deal if Irving was not going to agree to the two-year contract extension, according to league sources. The Lakers view both players as key members of their young supporting cast, not merely throw-ins. They were only considering including one of them if they had assurances Irving wouldn‚Äôt just be a second-half rental.

The FRPs we have are coveted assets but they are too distant in the future that it hurts their value; the lakers could very well have retooled by then and rebounded post lebron and AD

with that said - again we all know that we need salary going into the summer - why is everyone out on the utah deal?

Conley is a steady hand PG that shoots the 3 ball and can play both on or off the ball 

Beasley is a professional shooter and would immensely open up the offense

Vando is a young lockdown defender 

If you could swing those 3 with a follow up deal of Lonnie + bev + seconds, you‚Äôve built out a true roster with great role players 

Presumably you could have:

PG: Conley / DS
SG: Beasley / Austin / Max
SF: Vando / Rui / Troy

C: AD / Bryant / Jones

That all past us now, if health is an issue and Lebron decides to ‚Äúshut it down‚Äù after passing KAJ, do you think we have a fire sale this off season?

Seems like Lebron likes and wants to be in LA and yet I don‚Äôt think anyone would think twice about it if he wanted out and ended up back in Cleveland or Miami. AD is always a question on his health and availability each season and maybe if we ultimately look at it all and just trade both guys out and look towards a massive rebuild in what will probably be a rather weak off season for FAs, maybe the timing is meant to be?

Certainly we could get a nice bounty of picks from a team willing to roll the dice on AD and maybe a young player or two, Lebron will be still in demand especially if either Miami or Cle think they could win it all with his reunion.

&gt;From owner Jeanie Buss on down ‚Äî president of basketball operations Rob Pelinka, James, Anthony Davis and the whole lot ‚Äî the Lakers power brokers universally believe that the 30-year-old disenfranchised point guard from the Brooklyn Nets is the kind of player who would greatly improve their chances of contending for a title this season.

&gt;According to a source with knowledge of the Lakers‚Äô discussions with Brooklyn, a significant obstacle emerged in the early stages of the talks between the Lakers and the Nets. The source, who was granted anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation, said the Lakers were only looking to give the Nets the kind of return they‚Äôre requesting if Irving was willing to accept the two-year, $78.6 million extension they could immediately agree on as part of the deal.

&gt;But Irving strongly prefers to play his current contract out with his hypothetical new team and sign a four-year, $198 million maximum salary deal that would be available to him this summer (because the team trading for him would also acquire his Bird rights). That revelation wasn‚Äôt a deal breaker, but it was an eyebrow-raiser. The Lakers, the source said, would offer significantly less in a deal if it‚Äôs clear Irving was only guaranteed to be a second-half rental.

Right now, the Lakers can only extend him to a 2 year deal. If they want to extend him 4 years, it can only be done in the offseason. This means a risk of Kyrie going back on his promise of extending, and could potentially end up only as a 6 months rental if he chooses to sign to another team in free agency.

The Lakers are still intrested in a deal even if he doesn't sign the 2 year extension right now, but they would offer significantly less in the deal, since there is a risk he ends up being only a rental player, a reminder of how Dwight Howard left in free agency after the Lakers just traded for him in the previous offseason. 

&gt;It‚Äôs clear the Lakers have serious competition for Irving‚Äôs services here, meaning they may have to make unwanted concessions if they‚Äôre going to get this deal done. But the Lakers want Irving. We know that much now. The question of whether they can land him remains to be seen.
