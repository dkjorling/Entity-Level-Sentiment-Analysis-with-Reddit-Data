I think it‚Äôs time we put some respek on the 19‚Äô, aka the ‚ÄúTatum‚Äù, draft class‚Äô name.  2019 draft featured a bevy paddleswatch of superstars, all-stars, and potential one option players.  Here‚Äôs my list below!  Looking at it now is wild compared to perception of the same players back in the day.

I‚Äôm thinking:

Starters: Bev, Hield, LeBron, AD, Turner 

Bench: Schroder, Reaves, Lonnie Walker, Troy Brown, Wenyen 

Out of rotation/situational play: Nunn, JTA, Damian Jones, Thomas Bryant, etc. 

Seems like there could be a bit of redundancy between Lonnie and TBJ for second unit given that Schroeder and Reaves would be playing the 1 and 2. 

What y‚Äôall think of the bench rotation if we did Indy deal?",1.0

One anonymous Western Conference executive says Rob Pelinka has been smart in being patient with the Lakers so far this season

‚ÄùSo here was the quote from the Western Conference executive I spoke to who had mentioned this. He says ‚ÄòWashington is the one that I keep thinking that‚Äôs going to happen. If you‚Äôre the Lakers, don‚Äôt you think you can get Bradley Beal? He‚Äôs got a no-trade clause, he wants to come to California‚Äô ‚Äî That was an interesting tidbit of this ‚Äî ‚ÄòHe essentially can pick where he wants to go (because of his no-trade clause) and the most the Lakers can really give is those two picks. But if he asks out and says California or bust, the Wizards, because of the no-trade clause, the Wizards do potentially have to take a lesser deal.‚Äô Like if you just put Bradley Beal on the block right now, open to the entire league, you‚Äôd get better than Westbrook plus the two picks. I think you‚Äôd get a better offer. Although maybe not. Bradley Beal‚Äôs contract is massive, maybe someone says ‚Äòhey we‚Äôre doing you a favor taking this huge contract off your hands for a guy who can‚Äôt carry a franchise. Is Westbrook and the two picks enough? Well, if Bradley Beal says ‚ÄòI only want to go to California or I only want to go to the Lakers because I have a no-trade clause and I can steer this thing... So that‚Äôs the logic that the Western Conference exec was laying out to me, and he said this: ‚ÄòWhatever you want to say about Pelinka, he‚Äôs being smart, he‚Äôs taking his time.‚Äô‚Äù

Like if a team meeting with a player a week before free agency technically starts is tampering, surely demanding more from certain teams based solely on the fact that it‚Äôs a specific team is some form of tampering or something similar once it goes league wide as it just straight up makes it more difficult for the Lakers to make deals. Like it would be one thing if it was a few teams doing it because that would just negatively impact them by losing out on a potential trade partner since the rest of the league has better offers, but when the entire league does it it puts everyone at an advantage over that team, in which case how can that be considered fair in any way?
