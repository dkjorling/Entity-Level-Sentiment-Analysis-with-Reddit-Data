And where does a healthy AD rank?,EnergyFax,Just really curious where you would currently rank these guys in 2020 during our chip run. It was constantly said they were 2 of the top 5 guys in the league. Currently where do they rank in your opinions? I can see why the current front office is hesitant to make moves if they don't feel AD and Bron are top 10 guys anymore.,1.0
1,2022-11-07 06:44:25,yof4a1,The WHY's of Trashbrick.,iXzenoS,"Why does Trashbrick ""rock-the-baby"" each time he makes a wide-open layup/shot that every player - especially those getting paid $47m - should make...and then lose the game? I think he also did a shoulder-shimmy thing too? Again, all these antics for a fat juicy ""L"" on our record to close the night.

Why does he always steal rebounds away from our big-men? Like [this](https://youtu.be/5A9WY7nSaZk?t=39). I've seen it happen so many times where nobody from the other team is under the basket but he literally steals the rebound away by tapping the ball to himself and AD is like wtf... Gotta stat-pad even when benched?

And why is Ham so retarded that he benches Brick but still plays him 30+ min each game (which is basically the same as starting and kills our team) and keeps him in to close games?  He should only be given like 12-16min in short 3-4min bursts, if any; just enough to push the tempo with the second unit and keep us going, but not enough for him to become a comical clown with his stupid on-court antics and out-of-control wtf bricks/turnovers, especially in the 4th quarter.

Trashbrick is literally one of the worst, most unpleasant bums to watch in the NBA in recent years and hearing those delusional fanboy ""MVP"" chants has been so cringey smh.",0.5

6,2022-11-07 04:11:55,yocbbr,"Regarding the team's construction relative to the salary cap, a lot of people here are wrong.",BrianC_,"With increasing frequency, I've noticed a lot of arm-chair GMs complain here regarding how much money this team is paying Westbrook or how much money they're paying LeBron/AD and the resulting limitations that has put no the rest of the Roster.  People are saying that because so much salary is tied up in the big-3 or because of how little value the team is getting on Westbrook, it's impossible for them to be competitive.  I've noticed a lot of people say that because of this, a trade is necessary.

This is wrong.

It's also not only wrong to blame Jeanie or Pelinka for this, but downright stupid and toxic.

In order to understand this, you only need to take a quick look at the 2019-2020 roster and the 2022-2023 roster and compare their salaries.

NBA 2019-2020 Salary Cap: $109,140,000

Roster# | Player Name | Salary | % of Cap
:-- | :-- | :-- | :--
1 | LeBron | $37.4m | 34.4%
2 | Anthony Davis | $27.1m | 24.8%
3 | Danny Green | $14.6 | 13.4%
4 | Kentavious Caldwell-Pope | $8.1m | 7.5%
5 | Avery Bradley | $4.8m | 4.4%
6 | Javale McGee | $4m | 3.7%
7 | Quin Cook | $3m | 2.7%
8 | Alex Caruso | $2.8m** | 2.5%**

14 | Kyle Kuzma | $2m** | 1.8%**
15 | Talen Horton-Tucker | $0.9m** | 0.8%**

This was the final payroll of the 2019-2020 roster with some small exclusions like Dion Waiters, JR Smith, and 2-way contracts.

NBA 2022-2023 Salary Cap: $123,655,000

15 | Max Christie | $1m** | 0.8%**

*Even if these salaries differ, they are all minimum salary exceptions and the higher cost ones fall under veteran minimum exception clauses.

**These are rookie-scale contracts.

In a 1 to 1 comparison, outside of this current roster just being more expensive, it's important to look at each roster spot in specific.  As you can see, compared to the 2019-2020 team, this current roster is paying more or comparable amounts to the players at nearly every roster spot.  This has nothing to do with the increasing salaries of the NBA as the % of the cap normalizes for that.  Yes, the team is paying a huge amount of money for Westbrook, but the equivalent top 3 salary on that 2019-2020 team aside from LeBron and AD was Danny Green at $14.6m.  Moving down from there, Patrick Beverley is paid more than KCP was in relative value.  Walker IV is paid more than Bradley in relative value.  Nunn was paid more than McGee in relative value.  Etc.

The problem with this roster is not the salary distribution.  They proved in 2019-2020 that they could win with a cheaper overall salary distribution.  The problems are elsewhere --

1. LeBron James and AD are occupying relatively similar amounts of the cap but are no longer the players they were in the 2019-2020 season.  With LeBron, it's excusable.  With AD, it's not.  Because of their decline, more is needed from the rest of the team.  On that point, if this was the 2019-2020 roster, they would be even worse equipped to deal with 2022-2023 LeBron and AD.  So, stop saying that team was better constructed from a salary:depth perspective.  It was not.  People have his misconception that the way the two teams are built are different when they're not.  The 2019-2020 team was not big-2 + role-players anymore than it is now.

2. The 2019-2020 roster had some big steals relative to their cap%.  Dwight Howard, playoff Rondo, Markieff Morris, Kyle Kuzma and Alex Caruso all played well above their value.  For Kuzma and Caruso, you could credit the team.  With Howard, Rondo, and Morris, there was an element of chance.  From the current 2022-2023 roster, only Walker IV, Troy Brown Jr., and Austin Reaves are currently playing above their value to comparable degrees.

3. A number of current players are playing well below their value.  While Westbrook is playing well beneath his contract value of $47.1m and that's a major issue, similarly bad is the rest of the roster.  Patrick Beverley and Kendrick Nunn are performing well below their 19-20 counterparts in terms of cost:productivity.  Schroder and Bryant have been injured.  Jones has been a dud.  The rest are performing only about at expected value.

So, while yes, the roster could be better constructed in terms of salary distribution for depth, it's hardly the main point nor is it by itself some justification for anything.",1.0

11,2022-11-07 03:25:31,yobe64,To people wondering what happened,SgameB,"The minimum contract guys started playing like their contracts. Inconsistency is the reason those guys were available for a minimum or a TPMLE. It doesn't mean that they are not talented or don't put in the necessary work, they just lack consistency and that possession by possession desire to compete. In some games, they will play like starters – locked in defensively, aggressive, and making shots – leading their fans to think that they got some 15M guys for a steal. In other games, they will show up, perhaps, for a quarter and then disappear. After stacking a few losses and hurting their pride, those players will muster up enough motivation to again put together a full 48 min game and maybe even string a few wins together. However, they will become complaisant before long.

Now that is a very normal human behavior, it doesn't mean they are bad players, in fact, they have the skills and they are still getting paid millions, but you can't expect them to compete in every single game and every single possession. In most jobs, people can afford to get a little lax as they can pick up the slack later and still do really well, but not in competitive sports. They are competing at the highest level against the best in the world, that desire to compete every single day is precisely what separates minimum guys from 15M guys from max players, that's what separates mediocre teams from contenders from a championship team. 

Unless Darvin Ham can change who those minimum guys inherently are, expect a rollercoaster ride of a season. And I don't think you can in a few month change who they are, change their mindset, and change what makes them tick. If the prospect of getting a 60Million dollar contract didn't motivate them after their rookie contract, I don't think a stick from Darvin can do much either; they are not 20-year-old teenagers, they are who they are, inconsistent minimum guys.",1.0

With that being said those lows were expected, retirement of Kobe and the lack of talent around him and injured we knew tough times would be ahead. Yet even when Magic retired unexpectedly a lot of uncertainty, but Dr. Buss didn’t fold he kept on turning and finding talent to keep them competitive.

I will forever be thankful for the greatest sports owner to ever live he cared so much for its fans for the entertainment of it, the competitiveness of showing his product on the floor and producing in my lifetime 10
championships. But unlike him his children, have become and absolute laughing stock, have taken this franchise to levels i would never ever imagine the Los Angeles Lakers would become, a dumpster fire.

Jeanie Buss came in blazing hot taking the power of his brother which in his own right was a dumpster fire himself, she wanted to talk the talk but only came in and stumble walking getting her ankles broken left and right.

Her mistakes in my eyes would be solved as she gained more experience, boy was i wrong!. She has made those mistakes bigger, more miserable and frustrating to the fans and players. She allowed to many cooks in the kitchen, from Magic, Phil Jackson, The Rambi(uuuuuughhh!!!) and Pelinka. She has lost absolute control of the franchise, she will do her own PR rounds to suck up to the fans to distract from the incompetence she has employed.

Her massive mistake was the hiring of Pelinka, with her having and absolute loyalty to the late Kobe, she hires Pelinka who in the NBA circles was known as an absolute asshole to negotiate a person who people disliked to negotiate because of his abuse of power, and now the lakers are paying for it big time, since he has been here we have made in my opinion horrible trades and acquisitions that have put the worst product on the court, between him and Jeanie they dissolved a championship team for a bunch of old or bench players in the last two years. Not even Cleveland could build a team this horrible around LeBron. It’s just painful to see that another franchise player has fallen hard in the hands of Jeanie Buss.

As much as i would like to think when hard times came and Dr. Buss was here he had the confidence that he would show how to solve this problem immediately, i can’t say with 100% confidence that Jeanie and Pelinka will fix this and Bron will get his fifth chip with us. I don’t know how many of you felt when Bron signed an extension i personally felt confused as to why he would do it and only Bron knows why. But the extension to Pelinka was by far a massive L, he hasn’t shown the ability to be a GM, he has been MIA in trade deadlines and in answering tough questions on roster decisions. Not even Kupchak was this bad, he did made some questionable decisions but teams at least would talk to him and negotiate i can’t say the same thing is happening with Rob “Lowe” Pelinka.

So where do we go from here, i have read a lot of fans asking the Buss family to sell the team, and i have to agree, the lakers nepotism is on an absolute high, this team needs people who are not in any way related to the lakers, and let them help the team and inject some trust that they will be successful.

Sorry for the long vent and frustration, a band aid to this organization won’t fix future problems but ripping the band aid off and actually healing and learning from mistakes will actually make this franchise healthy again.

I hope many of you have a healthy avenue to vent, i have live the Lakers since i saw Magic so his first no look pass and never looked back i can only hope times like that will come soon.

Reasons were simple: his position is crowded, only his contract is somewhat tradeable and Lakers desperately needs wing depth.

Some r/lakers members were calling me out and they were sharing their enthusiastic opinions about Nunn who didn't played meaning minutes for more than a year. Also we shouldn't forget that he wasn't that good in his last season with the Heat. Let's see some comments to logical suggestion.

&gt; Watch what Nunn does this season. You’ll exclude him from your future “trade proposals”.

&gt; Why is everyone so inclined to dump Nunn in trades? He’s going to be a really good player for us if he plays like his Miami self

&gt; Fuck that. If Nunn is healthy he’s better than Crowder and the Pacers deal isn’t worth 2 firsts.

&gt; Why's everyone so sure Myles Turner and Buddy Hield would solve all our problems. Turner isn't nearly as good as people make him out to be. On top of that he's injury prone. Hield is basically slightly better Heat Nunn. 

&gt; We don’t need potential we need immediate contribution, Nunn gives us that and Reddish doesn’t

&gt; Nunn is being hyper underrated. Dude put up 2+ win shares in playoff basketball and is our second best shooter and, at this point, best off ball scorer in the backcourt. A Shroeder/Nunn/Bev/Reaves/Walker backcourt is really cool.

&gt; I wouldn’t trade Nunn unless it was in a trade bringing back much better talent

&gt; Nunn is solid man. He can provide scoring when the offense is stagnant.

They have been hustling on the defensive end. There have been lapses but the effort on the defensive end has been good and something to be encouraged with. 

The offense though has been quite bad. Especially in the half court. They obviously need the shooting but they also need someone who can also shoot off the dribble as well. LeBron used to do that but his jumper has been broken this season and even then he really is the only one who can do that. You need at least a couple of them in modern NBA. Its the case with almost every good team. There are often possessions where Lakers would look for openings to attack the paint but due to good defense, they would end up going nowhere and have someone take a off balanced bad bricked shot which more often than not ends up being a good chance for the opposition to get an easy bucket in transition. So, having a guy who can bail out with those shots would help the defense out as well because they can somewhat rest a bit and not rush back to stop transition almost every other possession.

Troy brown jr is trash. He shot way way to many shots in the 4th. Like there was a span of like 5 straight possesion were he just shot a few jumpers. He's also trash on defense.


Lonnie walker is way too inconsistent. Like he's getting good looks but isn't consistent with them. Also trash on defense.


Nunn is trash.


Westbrook started off hot in the first half making like  three 3s in a row but obviously wasnt sustainable. He was kinda of bad in the second half and some turnovers were costly.


Reaves is scared of shooting the ball. Like everytime russ or bron draw the defense in and lob it out to reeves, he pump fakes when the defender is like 2 meters away and just passes it in the end. He should really have some balls to take the shots.


Matt ryan was good as drawing defenses out of the box but he did get to shoot cause he couldnt get open.


I like gabriel. He's a good hustler but cant shoot so using him for 10-15 mins is fine.


LeBron was good today. He's still in his head cause he isnt making his normal shots and isnt hitting his 3s but its a good comeback game from him.


I'm not sure what to say about AD. He was good but something seemed off. Maybe its because they were playing zone and packed the paint so he couldnt get hus shots or lobs from LeBron and russ. But he really should stop shooting those iso's. They aint gonna fall.


As good as russ has been for us, we really should trade him for some pieces. We really need good rim protectors/ rebounders and 3 pt shooting. For example if we did the pacers deal, a lineup of:

LBJ, Buddy, matt ryan, AD, Turner.

Matt ryan, buddy, turner provide good spacing for LBJ and AD. LBJ, AD and Turner would cover somewhat for buddy and matt on defense.",0.71

51,2022-11-06 22:54:31,yo5ig0,This roster is so bad,Dismal_Committee_696,Outside of Austin Reaves this roster doesn’t help out Russ Bron or AD. JTA leaving his man open. Nunn already played himself out of minutes. Lonnie is lost more often than not on defense. Matt Ryan can shoot a little bit but thats all he can do. Wendell can’t shoot so hes an offensive liability. Just a lot of one sided liabilities so its like you can’t not play them but when you do theres just too many holes in their game.,1.0
52,2022-11-06 22:49:38,yo5eea,Some observations from the loss,tall_mf_,"Well first off, yes the officiating was absolutely terrible. If any of lakers breathed, they called a damn foul. But aside from that shorty officiating, we must really work on cutting down turnovers and MAKING OUR GODDAMN FREE THROWS! 

Holy shot it was infuriating watching the Cavs start like 22/23 from the line while we went 3/10. Also, some of the lineups today on the floor were absolutely terrible. Russ, Troy, gabriel and jta should NEVER share the court together. 

Another observation is that Lebron looked okay. A little better than last previous ones, but damn he can’t make a 3 to save his life. 

The only positive was that Russ looked alright",1.0

i think most of you know the threesome mentioned in the title. (If not, shame on you) 

With Darius now officially joining the Lakers, it means all three of them are employed by our beloved franchise. 

Darius' independency made him the most critical and unbiased of the three.  While I love Petes passion and his genuine Lakers fandom, you could see how being a Lakers employee made him more cautios with what he says on the pod. 

I like Mike as well, but not being a fan at first and working for the Lakers for over a decade led to him being pretty conservative and cautios with his opinions and takes. 

I love the LFR pod, but with all three of them now representing the P&amp;G in some form I wonder how honest and critical the pod can be in the future. 

Especially Darius was known for being pretty honest about certain things that went wrong within the organisation. 

I can still recommend the LFR pod for your daily dose of Lakers coverage. 

Peace!",1.0

78,2022-11-06 14:57:28,yns30o,So when do you think we are finally getting rid of Trashbrick?,iXzenoS,"Hopefully sooner the better, as we’re already starting to see an influx of delusional fanboys trying to hype him up after only a few subpar performances off the bench (just like they did with Caruso and Bonzo).

Clearly they’ve forgotten how comical it is that his so-called “Benchbrook“ performance is absolutely horrible for a player wasting $47m of our cap space while still being given starter-like minutes because Ham feels the need to cater to his hurt feelings and ego.

Evidently it’s even affecting LeBron’s performance because he needs to play alongside this brick-piler who not only can’t spread the floor but continues his cringy on-court antics like baby-cradling after every easy open layup or hilariously over-dribbling and dancing around the ball only to end up throwing a wild pass out of bounds and costing the team a crucial turnover. I genuinely feel sorry for LeBron that he’s gotta deal with this clown in the last remaining years of his career.

So, when do you think we are finally getting rid of Trashbrick?",1.0
