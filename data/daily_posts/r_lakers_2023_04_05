We had to win on the road against Bulls, Minnesota, Clippers, take care of business against Houston and Utah, and still have Suns coming up. All these while we had to throw 3 games in 4 nights into the mix.

We played well but it's unrealistic to expect all of these games to be Ws. 4-1 for the road trip is still great. 

1 Warriors loss in their last remaining 2 games would still really benefit us, but if not, a 7th seed would not be bad. 1 win out of 2 elimination games at home is more than possible. 

Right now, LeBron/AD health is more important than seedings. We probably shouldn't have pushed them to play tonight. Hopefully they can hold up the rest of the way.",1.0

2,2023-04-06 05:47:54,12dalbb,"When AD sits, Ham needs to be smarter with Lebron led lineups",MazKhan,"Lebrons most time without AD were spent with the following lineups

Lebron Schroeder Beasley Rui Wenyen(-122 net rating in 5 min which was our 2nd most used lineup) 

Lebron Schroeder TBJ Rui Wenyen (-33 net rating in 3 min) 

So our 2 most used non AD lineups where Lebron is still in didn't include either reaves or dlo, the lineup has no spacing and no defense.

 Also Wenyen isnt a capable backup 5 on any team, activating Bamba and not playing him makes absolutely no sense

13,2023-04-06 04:51:34,12d9guv,Is there anyone else here who isn‚Äôt worried about this loss? Or is it just me?,shadylocko,"Look, I get it. We lost to the Flippers for the 11th, count it, ELEVENTH time in a row. It absolutely stings, and the Lakers looked gassed and terrible (especially Lebron) for most of it. Not to mention the Pelicans and Mavericks overcame their own deficits and picked up Ws tonight while we didn‚Äôt.

But it‚Äôs not the end of the world. In fact we still have a chance for the 6th seed. The Flippers may have us completely and utterly downloaded and saved into their internal hard drives, but I want to remind you all that if they finish the 5th seed, they gotta play the Suns in the first round. And not only that, but if we finish 6th or 7th, we won‚Äôt even face the Clippers until the WCF, assuming both of us even get that far (which the Flippers most likely won‚Äôt since they gotta go through probably the Suns and Nuggets in a row). Of course we gotta take it one game at a time too.

If this is sounding like I‚Äôm afraid of that damn team, then it‚Äôs half true. I believe they are by far our worst matchup in the West (yes even more than a full powered Suns). Reason is at full power they have a better bench compared to the Suns and the coach is smart with using Westbrook. And finally at this point they have a mental advantage over the Lakers (I don‚Äôt think you could simply just brush off a 11 game losing streak on a team like that).

Im not saying that the Flippers will absolutely sweep us, as I do believe we still got a chance at beating them in a series, but it depends on a lot of factors, such as health and how well Darvin Ham can out coach Lue. I‚Äôm just trying to be realistic at our situation here. 

tldr: This loss isn‚Äôt the end of everything. We‚Äôll bounce back. Go Lakers. As for the Flippers, congrats on the win and enjoy getting destroyed by KD in the first round. üëç",0.99
14,2023-04-06 04:39:42,12d986v,Positives and Negatives of the game,anjing0,"Reasons to not be too down  
* LeBron had the worst game of his life in the 1st half, there's no way he ever plays that bad again. He was cooking whoever was in front of him in the 2nd half
* 3rd game in 4 days, there was a reason both stars were GTD decision

Small Positives
* Slowed down Kawhi in the 2nd half really well, 

Negatives - 
* Ham taking way too long to take timeouts and leaving Dennis in when Powell was abusing him
* Leaving Wenyen all alone on Zubac? This should had been the time to test out Bamba, to see what he has before the playoffs
* Another game where the opponent is on fire from 3, we need to throw in some zone from time to time to keep them guessing

Yeah, it sucks that we will be in the play-ins but if we can't beat 2 play-in teams than we never deserved a chance, and I'm also quite confident in our ability against Denver and Memphis",1.0

In what reality do you have to be in to start the crucial CRUCIAL 4th quarter with Dennis Schroder AND MALIK BEASLEY??? AT THE SAME TIME??? Literally the two smallest guys on our team, one of which is completely reliant on shots being created for him and the other only creates shots for himself, not to mention he is having a terrible shooting night???? That is a game losing decision. 

Putting in Wenyen Gabriel as your backup C for the night when he is getting bullied by two of the strongest centers in the league, WHEN MO BAMBA IS RIGHT THERE AND CAN ALSO BE A FLOOR SPACER?!?! That is a game losing decision. 

Not recognizing that schroder is having an off-night and still pairing him up with D-Lo even though Malik Beasley was hitting his shots early? Does he not realize how much more sense a dlo-beasley backcourt makes when beasley is hitting??? Especially when he is struggling lately and we need to squeeze out any sort of three point shooting we can get from him because that is literally the only thing he provides this team??? That is a game losing decision. 

I understand he is a rookie coach, and I an generally patient with him, but he clearly has shown 0 willingness to change what isnt working and 0 willingness to take advantage of what is working (unless it involves schroder). It is mindblowing. We need to be competing right now, and ham seems like a good guy but he CLEARLY does not fit the timetable. 

At the end of the day, all you can do is pray he learns from his mistakes, because he is clearly here for the longterm, but goddamn he can be frustrating.",1.0

95,2023-04-05 16:52:06,12cqjb2,Adopting the Long View,threepointcheese,"Dear Pessimists:

178 men and women have been inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame for their playing careers. 29 of these players have played on the Lakers. These names include:

G: **Kobe Bryant,** **Gail Goodrich**, **Magic Johnson**, Bobby Leonard, **Clyde Lovellette**, **Slater Martin**, Steve Nash, Don Nelson, Gary Payton, **Mitch Richmond**, **Jerry West**  
F: **Elgin Baylor**, Adrian Dantley, Karl Malone, Dennis Rodman, Charlie Scott, Jamaal Wilkes, **James Worthy**  
C: **Kareem Abdul-Jabbar**, Zelmo Beaty, **Wilt Chamberlain**, Vlade Divac, Connie Hawkins, **Spencer Haywood**, **Bob McAdoo**, **George Mikan**, **Vern Mikkelsen**, **Shaquille O'Neal**, **Jim Pollard**

Some of these men have been inducted for their playing careers elsewhere, for instance, Don Nelson, the lockdown sharpshooting guard, who had a limited role on the Lakers behind Jerry West but ultimately won championships with the franchise's greatest rival, the Boston Celtics. Some of these men have been inducted for their playing careers elsewhere but contributed to Laker titles as role players, for instance, Spencer Haywood, who late in his career played one year behind Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. 

This year, Pau Gasol will be inducted into the Hall of Fame for his time on the Lakers. His number was retired for that accolade and the two chips he won with the team, back to back, in 2009 and 2010. However, nearing the end of his time with the Lakers, fans of this franchise were begging for his trade. Calling him soft, calling him washed, Pau Gasol was unceremoniously dumped by rabid fans who wanted... other guys. It shames me to say, I was one of them.

The franchise currently rosters two Hall of Fame caliber players both of whom have won a championship with the Lakers. These players are LeBron James and Anthony Davis. These two players will win their second ring with the Lakers this year and, in all likelihood, go back to back for their third ring in five years, next year. Your pessimism is correct only on this front: it hasn't been the prettiest journey. When LeBron came to the franchise, we were stoked. We had LeBron fucking James, but we could also sense that you folks adopted him with mixed feelings, with the sort of... what the fuck are you going to do for us, old man, attitude. With Anthony Davis, his reception, to say the least, soured. After dominating in the bubble, Davis's aggressive playstyle has not been kind to his body and he has been injured for the last three years. Moreover, when he plays, it always takes him time to regain his top tier dominance.

But what if I told you these two men are precisely Lakers? Not Don Nelson, not Spencer Haywood, not Nash, GP, Malone, or Rodman. They aren't a Cavalier, a Heatle, nor a Pelican. These guys are thoroughbred Lakers. At the end of this run, LeBron James will have won 3 championships with the Lakers, while having played 7 years with the team with outstanding numbers, having raised his children here in the most critical parts of their upbringing. He's already played more years here than with the Heat and will have had more championships here than with the Heat (2) or Cavaliers (1). 

What if I told you AD is our second, dare I say, better, Pau Gasol? Sure, he's had his issues, but three rings? With at least five years on the team? Of course, management has to build correctly around him, but how is it that so many fans don't regard him as a Laker? Do we call to push him out when there's more in the tank, as with Pau, who was a two time all star post LA?

One of the things I love about this city is that we are super inclusive. It doesn't matter if you're white, black, mexican, or asian, if you're LA, you're LA. It's a vibe. But sometimes that inclusiveness, the bubble, if you will, lashes out hard against, outsiders. Someone like LeBron, someone like AD. Is it right to have that mentality?  Maybe, maybe not. The worst of you will retaliate asking if they've earned it. To that, all I can say is this, it relates to this city, who's done more. You in whatever the fuck you're doing or their three rings.

If the Lakers weren‚Äôt prepping for a b2b, they would be blown this team out by 20 and put forth full effort much like they did against the Rockets the other night.

100,2023-04-05 14:22:17,12clzpf,LeBron needs to rest today even if it puts us at risk of Play-in,CryptoNite90,"I saw the post earlier saying how any team could get how like Utah and we should avoid the play-in, and I agree, but not at the cost of LeBron re-aggravating his injury because of playing a back to back. 

Lebron just said post-game last night that he still wakes up with pain after game nights and he pretty much has a treatment plan on how to take care of it and then the pain subsides. 

We need to keep in mind that 2 out of 3 doctors already recommended a season ending surgery which LeBron avoided. This was a torn tendon and the man was driving into the paint all night and in scoring mode to ensure a victory for us which I feel he was trying to save for the playoffs to play that aggressively.

This is from an interview right before coming back from injury this time:

James got candid about whether or not he would undergo surgery following the regular season to treat the injury.

""I don't know,"" James said. ""Right now I don't need it, so we'll see what happens. I'll probably get another MRI at the end of the season and go from there.""",1.0

In 2020 season, we never had a relatively easy game even against bottom tier teams. It was our defense and dominance of AD and Lebron duo sealed the deal. And tonight lebron sealed the deal.
