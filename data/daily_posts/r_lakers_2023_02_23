However, his stats for the series are abysmal compared to the regular season and the first 3 series, so it seems like he might have already been injured before the Finals. 

Does anyone know if Scott was injured for the entire series, or not until Game 4 and he just had an awful Finals?",1.0

I've not, even since the beginning, been a big Darvin champion but I'm starting to see maybe this squad will highlight his best coaching instincts, toughness and defense and a desperate energy to win at all costs.
