2-10‚Ä¶

Unfortunate injuries to our two best players‚Ä¶The never ending drama with Russ‚Ä¶too many guards‚Ä¶heartbreaking losses at the hands of refs‚Ä¶Hella frustration and anger towards the front office‚Ä¶Rob labeled a Terrorist‚Ä¶

This season has legit been a fuckin roller coaster. There were times I genuinely gave up watching the next 2-3 games and would only check the box score‚Ä¶game chat was fuckin unbearable (man that shit still is honestly ü§£) 

Then we get rui‚Ä¶then dlo Vando beas and Mo shoutouts reed too 

Then bron goes out but Davis shows the fuck up and carries the team. We start winning because defense had become the backbone of our identity‚Ä¶

Trevor Lane drops an amazing tweet after that tough Dallas loss that still runs through my mind and I‚Äôm just happy to see the turn around we‚Äôve made. 

Best record in the west since the moves. 

43-39 but we are clearly etter than that. 

Vanilla Ice
Vandelorian
The King
Wilt Davis
Black Samurai 
Menace
Threasly (corny idc)

We are comin and these mufuckas ain‚Äôt ready

r/nba in shambles   


Wolves on the grill next and our dealin wit hella internal drama. 
We are fuckin clickin and bron is rounding into form.
 Most importantly we are healthy.

2,2023-04-10 05:38:48,12h8jmm,Bill Simmons does a full 180 on whether the Lakers are a title contender in the span of one sentence,2chanz,"In his latest podcast today, notorious Celtics homer Bill Simmons went from saying the Lakers have no chance at even making the finals, to saying that it‚Äôs not unlikely all in one sentence. This team has been playing so well that even someone like him is forced to admit it. Every fiber of his being wants to discredit the Lakers, but it‚Äôs at a point where doing that is so blatantly inaccurate, that he can‚Äôt do it without risking his reputation as someone with serious basketball analysis.

The full quote was: ‚Äú[People have been saying the Celtics] might have to face the Lakers in the finals! I just think it‚Äôs impossible for them to stay healthy for three straight rounds.‚Äù 

That was the first take, that it‚Äôs impossible. Without skipping a beat he went on to say: ‚ÄúI just don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs realistic.‚Äù We‚Äôve gone from impossible to not realistic.

Finally he ends on: ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs at least not unrealistic, it‚Äôs in play.‚Äù We‚Äôve made the leap from not realistic to not unrealistic, insert Nick Young ??? face. The man CAN NOT EVEN FORM A COHERENT THOUGHT he‚Äôs so shook by how good the Lakers are.

In closing I‚Äôm excited to continue to watch this team prove people wrong. I‚Äôm not even a Lakers fan in full transparency, but am rooting for y‚Äôall for the playoffs since it‚Äôs been awesome watching AD, Lebron, Reaves, Vando, Dlo, and Schroder these past few months. Go Lakers!!",1.0

Davon Reed was just cut so the real value was only the picks. However, considering that Mo Bamba was out for the past month, the Lakers had no real backup center and Wenyen Gabriel has proven he's not fit for that role. Having Thomas Bryant during that month would've helped take the load off of AD and we might've won a few more games.

This team was lacking size anyways so having more centers is better.",1.0

But IF we get past the Timberwolves and the grizz, I think that warriors team is going to be hard as shit. I don't think we have the shooting to keep up with their runs and our role players simply do not have the experience they do. Coaches? I'm not a Ham hater but its not even close.

For me, there are only two-Bird and Rondo.  

Bird needs no explanation.

He's a fucking liability and our weakest link going into the playoffs. Can we get a fucking normal back up defensive big who can guard, rebound, and finish a few dunks???",1.0

75,2023-04-09 17:42:02,12gq1tg,I dare the Clippers to tank down to 7th and play us.,shadylocko,"So apparently there is a chance that the Clippers lose and Pels win, causing the Clippers to play the Lakers in the Play-In.

Although I‚Äôm nervous about them playing us, this also poses an interesting opportunity. Lakers must be absolutely seething from the Wednesday embarrassment they received, and should be looking to avenge it. Let‚Äôs be honest, we are gonna have to play these guys at some point in the playoffs, and if we gotta play em, now is the best time when they don‚Äôt have PG. Assuming Lakers don‚Äôt get anyone injured today, this team going into the Play-In should have NO excuses at all. They got the rest, now they should be focused. Lebron is not gonna have another 3pt half, nor will the team be super gassed. We have all the tools we need to beat them just ONCE.

Finally, just think about it. If we beat them, they gotta face the Wolves or Thunder. Imagine they gotta play the Thunder and LOSE? It would be the most magnificent display of irony ever, and I want to see it unfold lol. 

Tldr: If Clips tank down to play us in the play in, so be it. But Lakers will be ready; I hope they know that.",1.0

He was out the last couple of games because of multiple issues. It could be he's going to miss multiple games due to rest from some the injuries, adding a defensive guard could be a huge sign for that. 


Hope DS can catch up, the man plays hard with a lot of energy, we could lose a lot of losing him going into the post season",1.0

It seems like hes really trying to get a rhythm for his jumper before the playoffs and is not attacking as much to preserve his foot/not reinjure it. In the 2nd half vs the clippers which was important, he focused on driving to the rim alot to try and get the W. It seems like the other games he was confident he didnt need to assert himself as much driving to the basket because a W could be had without it. Suns game he took alot of jumpers and barely drove, i expect the same from him today unless the game calls for him to be aggressive. Lebron is gonna turn it up big time in the playoffs, just my 2 cents, interested to see if anyone thought the same",1.0
