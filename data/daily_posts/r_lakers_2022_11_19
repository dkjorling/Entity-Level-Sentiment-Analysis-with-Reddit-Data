0,2022-11-20 06:59:47,yzxlg8,How do you guys feel about a move for Alec Burks?,TorontoRaptors34,"I think a small pick up like Alex Burks can be a really solid deal for this team. 
I think a Bev/Nunn for Burks deal would be fairly solid. I would like to think theres a way to acquire him without getting rid of Bev but regardless it makes the most sense.

U replace a vet for a vet. Detroit can get Bev to really help give some toughness and direction for the young guys in Detroit like he did for Minnesota or trade Bev again to another team. 

Burks would be a solid pick up because 
- He 6”6 gives u solid size on the wing and the perimeter
- Can SHOOT THE BALL! He’s a guy who can help take some load off the wings on this team like Troy especially and can even play the point at times as a luxury. 
- He's not too old he 31 and he has a fair amount of experience in the league. 

I think this is the best minimal move than can help light this team give it a bit clarity. 
This way u have direct guard and wing rotations that can be fairly switchable. To me there is no such thing as a crowded wing rotation youd much rather have a wing squad than a guard one. If u start him at the point u can have some nice spacing and it gives more energy for a guy like Troy Brown who the teams very reliant on as a wing.
I like Bev and maybe theres a way where u can do this without giving him up but personally I think the best way to keep a dynamic while making a move is trade Bev for Burks straight up. I feel Burks versatility will allow u to do more with either the starters or the bench squad. 

PS(off topic) Ham needs to bench Nunn for good and replace him with Ryan full time.",1.0

He came into the season under the weather and hobbled and the sheer amount of you jumping on that as a chance to eXpOsE his regression is crazy. LET HIM GET HEALTHY. Not only are y’all showing your bias and frankly shitty fan hood of a team (rooting on the leaders downfall), y’all are also showing your inability to use context in your argument. “His isolation scoring wasn’t as efficient as it could’ve been last year” newsflash guys, the team sucked last year and when that’s the case, efficiency numbers go down. It felt like bro was playing 1-5 at times out there. This ain’t rocket science guys, it’s kinda simple reasoning and common sense… HOLY you opportunistic haters make this place a cesspool.",0.99

He can’t get to the rim and score literally whenever he wants anymore like when he was in his prime(also partly due to poor spacing).

Make the Hield/Turner trade and this team will be true contenders. 

Starting 5: Bev-Hield-Lebron-AD-Turner

Bench: Schroeder/Nunn-Walker(6)-Reaves-Brown/Wenyen-Bryant

Closing Lineup: Lebron-Hield-Walker-AD-Turner

Stagger Lebron and AD throughout the game besides the starting unit and closing lineup. Let Lebron be a true PG and run with all floor spacers. This is when you’ll get the absolute best out of him. 

Lebron-Hield-Walker-Brown-Turner

Let AD play the 4 and run a lot of minutes with Schroeder and Bryant.

15,2022-11-19 21:27:23,yzmlf1,“lEbRon iS tHe PRobLeM”,Academic-Principle14,"They beat the Nets and Pistons in the past couple games…people are acting like they beat Celtics and Bucks. Calm down. If you really think this team is better without Lebron, then you are an idiot. 

The problem with this team is that there are no elite shooters, which slows down Lebron and AD cause the paint is so clogged. Period. 

I’ve heard people say that Lebron stymies the talent of other players(citing Bosh and Kevin Love as examples). Do people not realize that it’s literally fucking impossible for 3 ball dominant superstars to function at max potential when they’re all on the same team? Bosh and Love took a step back because they were the worst of the 3 superstars on those teams. It had nothing to do with Bron making them worse as players. It’s about doing a job for a team to maximize the potential of the team, which they did. And I never get why people complain about Love and Bosh’s roles…they literally put up good numbers and won multiple championships with Lebron. 

Also, It’s a myth that Lebron can’t play off ball. His catch and shoot 3 pt stats last year were on par with Tatum, Middleton, and Lowry in terms of volume and %. Plus he’s excellent at cutting and he can do PNR. 

I do agree that Lebron needs to cut down on stalling the ball in the half court when he returns. But he was only doing that cause other guys were shitting the bed when it came to creating their own shot. The supporting cast is finding their way now, but it was not that way earlier in the season and it’s not like Bron wasn’t giving them the oppportunity to showcase their talents as they’ve done the past couple games. The supporting cast simply wasn’t executing. 

PS. This team will also be much better when Lebron gets out of his shooting slump.",1.0

Obviously 2041 is far away, however I think it’s safe to say anyone hoping to break it by then would have to already be in the NBA, and seeing as nobody (nope, not even Luka) is on pace to break it, we could very well see this record stay with the Lakers for 75 years. With all the negativity surrounding our team now (rightfully so, fuck Jeanie Buss), it’s cool to see that for 3/4 of a century, the top of the scoring list will have worn purple and gold.",1.0

AD is playing like he did in New Orleans, and he’s working well with Westbrook. The LeBron Effect is real. It has existed in Cleveland, Miami, and LA. Again, LeBron is the team’s best player, but he makes others take a step back when he’s on the court. Prime Examples: Kevin Love, Chris Bosh, Russell Westbrook, AD. Whether you agree or not, this team has been at its best this season without LeBron. These guys are gelling so far, and when he comes back, he’s going to have to fit in. WATCH, once he comes back into play, the team is going to faulted into its same mistakes. There’s obviously people such as Pat Bev that aren’t showing up, but regardless, my point still stands.

Stop this nonsense about AD and Lebron is old, no, that's not true at all, Lebron is still very quick and agile, still to this day, no one can stop him from going to the basket at will, that's not a guy who is old, his shooting will return as he continues to find his last season's shooting form, and when that time comes, he will score 30-40 again as easy as hot knife going through butter like last season. As for AD, no need to explain more as you saw from your very eyes that he's already on his way to returning to the monster AD form.

When you have Lebron and AD, you are always, always one or two moves away from changing the fate of your franchise.
