Nobody knows if the Indy move is still on the table but you take that and this team is a contender. Other moves like Bojan could help, but probably won't swing the needle enough",1.0

In minutes where Westbrook is off the floor this season, the Lakers are a -3.4 per 100 possessions this season, the equivalent of a 28 win team.

Right now, we are 11-16 in the season, which is on pace for a 33-49 record through 82 games, which funnily enough, is where we were last year.

NY Receives:PatBev, Nunn, Jones
Lakers Receives: Fournier, Reddish, 2 Second Round Picks

Sign Cousins and PJ Dozier

Why Dozier and Cousins? Dozier is currently in the G-League shooting over 40% from deep. I do not expect him to shoot that well going forward but he would be like 13 guy off the bench so it does not really matter. Cousins Played well towards the end of last year with the Nuggets. He is not there to eat massive minutes. Just enough to spell AD and be a big body in the middle that can bang with bigs for a while. 

Roster after the trade would be 
PG:Reaves, Westbrook, Schroder
SG:Walker, Fournier, Christie
SF:Reddish, Brown, Dozier
PF:Lebron, Gabriel, JTA
C: Davis, Bryant, Cousins

1) It ideal solves one of our biggest issues this year which is size and we instantly get much bigger. Entire starting 5 would be 6'4"" and up. I don‚Äôt think this makes us favorites but it makes us more dangerous. We don‚Äôt need a big to eat up massive minutes but we need to spell AD and not have any interior presence 

2) We gain 2 second round picks which we have been very good with drafting

3) Cam reddish is a restricted free agent and we would own bird rights. We could resign him to a 2 year contract with a team option the second year. 

4) We retain flexibility to bring back Lonnie, Reaves, Westbrook? Out of those 3 only real concern is Lonnie but it should work out money wise as long as you resign him first and then sign Reaves and Westbrook because of the arenas rule and bird rights for Westbrook
A) even if we move Westbrook later at the deadline for a Kuzma type piece we would have bird rights on him. 

5) Fournier contract really is not that bad after this season next year it‚Äôs an expiring 18m which is an asset. 

6) Puts Us in a position to make a run for whatever free agent we want in 2024 and 2025

This makes Rob look really bad, especially in the eyes of Bron and AD who‚Äôve already been reported as being impatient and wanting to compete this season, so why would he put this out there? 

Is there someone else in the front office that knew this was the plan and leaked it because they aren‚Äôt on the same page as Rob? (another dysfunctional FO situation)

Did it come from Klutch who was merely speculating or were they told no moves would be made?

I don‚Äôt doubt the report. Haynes got it from somewhere, but it‚Äôs such an odd thing to admit if everyone‚Äôs on the same page.

Do you think Ham should have taken a timeout there?? Is that a fair criticism, because BRON was struggling to get to half court and was damn near looking like he‚Äôs about to fall over((heavy legs)).

Does his staff go back and analyze moments like that to change future strategy?? A quick rest, plus time to go over an important possession, seems like it was the best play to me. I also think someone else brought this up here, I think it was Early-Candidate.

Regardless, I think that was a very big learning moment game for Ham. Hoping it molds him into a smarter coach. I realllly wish we had a coach who can help push us over the edge, instead of holding us back. I‚Äôm not low on Ham or anything, I know it takes time for a first time coach to figure out how to coach and how to mixcromanage little things like that. I just want him to turn that corner sooner rather than later.

TLDR: Ham is still new coach, figuring out his own philosophy. I just hope staff looks at moments like that to determine if a winning chess move can be made instead of saying, ah fuck it, let this play out. That possession ended up in a bad shot, no points.",1.0
