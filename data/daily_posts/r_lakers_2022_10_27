I didn't start following the Lakers until after Magic retired. My first Lakers team was Cedric Ceballos, Eddie Jones, Nick Van Exel, Elden Campbell, and Vlade. Sure they never won a championship, and Nick might get suspended for weeks at a time for knocking over a ref, and Ced might literally go missing for weeks at a time, but that was a fun team! A playoff team. Maybe this is old man yelling at clouds, but it blows my mind that a team with Lebron, AD, and Westbrick won't make the playoffs, but that 90s Lakers squad did and even had some playoff victories.",0.91

Most of our legends were either due to draft or trade. Don‚Äôt understand, especially when people say this to justify trading picks away. If I‚Äôm missing something enlighten me

Edit. In all of lakers history we‚Äôve signed 2 insane free agents. And one was in his mid 30s. Doesn‚Äôt justify the narrative to me. Players we‚Äôve traded for with assets and players we‚Äôve drafted out weigh the only 2 players we‚Äôve signed in free agency imo

We drafted magic, jerry west, and (George mikan if you count it lmao). 
We traded for Kareem Kobe and Wilt.

21,2022-10-27 20:33:32,yf2kpb,Lakers should learn from Celtics Rebuild.,WestofBricks,"Everyone seems to be arguing whether to try to improve the team this year by making a trade or holding tight and making a move in the off season to improve.

The reality is though that the Lakers window has shut. The league overall has gotten significantly better in the last couple years. There are more teams then ever that believe they have a chance at making the finals. 

The Lakers are in danger of making the same mistake with Lebron that they did with Kobe Bryant and that is to hang on to a team going nowhere and not acting in the franchises best interest. Hanging on with Kobe resulted in a lost decade for the Lakers. Doing the same with Lebron could be even worse.

Danny Ainge several years ago recognized the end of the era with Pierce and KG and made a move with the Nets that allowed them to activate a much faster rebuild and they got back into contention the East extremely quick. The vision for this franchise should be to blow it up and start fresh.

Moving AD this year would bring a ton of assets from one of the teams trying to contend. Lebron can break the scoring record this year and you can move him for more assets. 

The Lakers could acquire a boatload of picks between the two moves and have an almost entire clean cap.

Lakers are about winning championships not 6th seeds. LeBron is about winning championships. Get him to the postseason, seeding doesn‚Äôt matter. It‚Äôs 0-0 when the series starts. 

There is no trade available right now that makes them contenders. That‚Äôs why they didn‚Äôt do the Indy deal. Fans need to be patient and remain optimistic. 

This roster was created to not have Russ on it. They‚Äôre competing hard defensively &amp; AD/Bron both look great. This team is only lacking 2 3 &amp; D wings (maybe a better C). 

I applaud Rob &amp; Jeanie for this offseason. LeBron is here for 2-3 years so is AD. The move they make needs to solidify the future. 

I‚Äôd rather be a play in with the right pieces than be a 6th seed with no future. They should‚Äôve beat the suns in 2021 had they stayed healthy. How hard is winning one game on the road when you have LeBron &amp; AD surrounded by the right pieces? 

Take away that this team defends, AD looks good, LeBron hasn‚Äôt fallen off and guys like Lonnie, Reaves, JTA, Bev &amp; Brown Jr know their roles. 

We need to be rooting for the right trade.",0.55
