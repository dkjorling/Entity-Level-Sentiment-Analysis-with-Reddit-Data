5,2022-11-26 04:51:47,z4yfhw,Rob Pelinka's worst nightmare,Inevitable_Night_933,"The team I will say as a whole looks ""ok"" 20+ turnovers to the Spurs is not great. 

However AD is playing at an MVP level and LeBron continues to look strong. Lots of championship level role players like Reaves and Walker.

And with an easy schedule coming up we ""should"" be around .500 ball by mid December or whenever the 20th extension of this was.

So what happens from here? Pelinka cares more about his job security than actually helping this year's team contend for a championship. The Hield Turner offer we SHOULD have accepted in the offseason has undoubtedly gone up since then. Any other trade Pelinka will get heavily scrutinized for AND if he even makes the Hield/Turner trade now people will complain and bitch that he could have done before the season and saved us 10+ losses.

I will be stunned if he actually makes a move involving any FRP's. Those are his last lifeline to not getting fired and sadly he is a selfish man. What do you think?",1.0

26,2022-11-26 01:00:07,z4tp8a,"I am 100% dead serious when i say I think there is at least a 50% chance that lebron is a genetically modified human being and in turn, has no father",Jets2022Champs,"I am dead serious. I believe lebron was grown in a test tube and then artificially implanted into Gloria James and carried to term. no human being should possess his combination of size, strength and athleticism. AND to book it all out, he's very intelligent too. (besides the decision) remember how much poise he had just coming into the league at 18 years old? it's un-natural. how often have TV analysts described him as a ""freak of nature"" .....maybe it's truer than we know.

I am serious. we all know (and I swear I am not saying this to be insulting or mean) that lebron's mom was a crack whore (is drug addicted prostitute better?) it's just a fact, it happened. I am NOT saying this to be mean, in fact I am a heroin addict and know a few woman who have sold themselves for dope, it happens. they are not bad people.

and the government has a history of using prostitutes and impoverished people in ""experiments."" read about MK-ULTRA. it happened. the CIA used to have prostitutes slip LSD to johns and then the agents would watch what happened thru 2-way mirrors. the government helped start and continue the crack epidemic of the 80s.

I believe that lebron was a precursor experiment to create super soldiers. something where they were just like ""well let's test it out on some poor people that no one will notice and see if we can get any results before we sink more billions into this.""

it's not all that crazy. you don't think the government has interest in creating genetically modified super human soldiers? we know for a FACT it does. it's been documented. you don't think russia or china has interest in such a thing? you know they do. and anything russia or china is or would be doing we are doing. to do it first and do it better.

he's some kind of experiment that they just monitored from a distance and let keep growing. and i mean this was probably initially started with just a few people who believed it could be done and that's why it started small and covert using regular civilians. until they could show the results to the higher ups and say ""look at this, you don't wanna fund this on a larger scale?""

and where else would such a person end up besides in a professional sports league?

I think there is probably some secret base(s) out there that are now filled with people like lebron, younger than him probably. if they couldn't see how well the experiment worked until he was about 16-18 years old (he was pretty much a full grown man at 16 and could have came off the bench for any NBA team if not started) than maybe there are a bunch of 9-15 year old super humans like lebron (not copies of him but given the same genetic boost that he was) eating chow in some secret barracks right now.....

until someone comes forth and the DNA test shows him to be his father (and a bunch have come forward and been shown not to be) than I will believe this is AT LEAST possible..",1.0

35,2022-11-25 22:25:45,z4q5l5,Funny how celtics are public enemies of lakers and Lebron before he came here,junahn,"Lakers-Celtics rivalry was always a thing but Lebron and Celtics rivalry was crazy too.

Despite the pistons and spurs who were the unanimous top dogs against the cavs in 2006 and 2007, Celtics during big three era and Lebron was always a close series.

2008 was one of those peak years of Lebron who was just one man army and his other teammates were embarrassments. 

2010 series was the crucial point which made Lebron go to Miami and form big three with wade and Bosh.

2011, Lebron demolished them in 5 games, and 2012 the legendary game 6 happened.

Surprisingly, after big three ended, Celtics kept face Lebron in playoffs, like in 2015 and 2017 when Isiah Thomas was balling. 

And Kyrie went to the celtics and betrayed Lebron, and celtics faced Lebron again in 2018 and it was a battle of 7 games series. 

Btw Lebron averaged 28.8 points 7.2 rebounds and 7.0 assists in 56 games versus the Celtics in his career. Which is almost highest among his stats against every other team  


As lebron fan, even though media said Warriors was Lebron's biggest enemy, I still think celtics was Lebron's worst enemy. Probably spurs after that.",1.0
