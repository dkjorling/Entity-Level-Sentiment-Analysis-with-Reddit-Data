0,2022-12-18 07:32:04,zosytp,I don’t see Kuzma returning.,laskeshowbroyo,"1: Everything he’s been saying lately in the media is true. His role was switched game to game in LA, as was his playing time. He never was able to get into any sort of rhythm. 

2:  Kuz said he plays Bron and ADs positions, so he didn’t have the freedom offensively he has in Washington. I agree with this as well and think it would be a problem again for him as far as getting the shots and minutes he wants if he were to return. 

3: Pride. Lakers traded Kuz and included draft picks. If the lakers now trade for Kuz and and give up more picks, it’s essentially like giving up two first rounders to get the player they traded away back.It’s terrible optics for the Lakers front office. 
For Kuz, he’s in a contract year so he wants to have great looking stats heading into the off-season for a big deal. Washington gives him the opportunity to capitalize on stat stuffing while his minutes and scoring opportunities would go down in Los Angeles. 

4: I don’t think the lakers FO want to give up a pick for a player who already said he’s looking for a big long term contract this off-season. The lakers FO will not give him that contract. If that’s the case, the lakers see Kuz as a rental in their eyes, and,  because he alone would not nearly be enough to make the lakers championship contenders again, I don’t see the FO making this trade. He doesn’t really fill in many of the holes the lakers currently have in their roster.",1.0

We’ve seen enough from both players, would you have still made the trade looking back?

Coming off a torn ACL and just not looking very mobile prior to that, I didn't think he was going to bring very much. I'm super happy to be wrong, because he's been playing solid and with a ton of energy.
