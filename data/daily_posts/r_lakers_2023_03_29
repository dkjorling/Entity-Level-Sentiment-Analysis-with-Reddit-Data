2,2023-03-30 05:15:09,126cj5a,BIGGEST GAME OF THE SEASON ON FRIDAY: Lakers vs Wolves,OhMyMe17,"Wolves have a ridiculously easy schedule after the Lakers.

- Blazers
- Nets
- Spurs
- Pelicans

This essentially means that if the Lakers lose on Friday, 7th seed will be out of reach, let alone 6th seed. With both teams at 38 losses, this is the biggest game of the season for the Lakers. More than any other game in the past.

It's annoying and repetitive at this point to say this, but it's more true than ever: BIGGEST MUST WIN game right here. No exceptions. Get it done.",1.0

I don‚Äôt know why this seems to be such a hard concept for our team to grasp. Frankly, staggering is so important that even if we had 2 of the above 3 available, we should still stagger them similarly. 

On another note, our team‚Äôs goal should be to avoid Bron and AD playing more than 36 minutes a game until the playoffs. I think this is achievable with a healthy DLo but just another priority I believe we should emphasize.

Not to pile on Ham, but we really need to optimize our minutes played.",1.0

AD, Reaves, DLo, Vanderbilt, Lebron

Reserves...
Brown, Schroeder, Rui, Gabriel, Beasley

General Substitution order...
1st sub: Lebron&gt;&gt;Troy Brown
2nd sub:Reaves&gt;&gt;Schroeder
3rd sub: Vanderbilt&gt;&gt;Rui
4th sub:DLo&gt;&gt;Beasley

12th sub: Gabriel&gt;&gt;AD
13th sub:Brown&gt;&gt;Lebron
14th sub: Reaves&gt;&gt;Beasley&gt;&gt;End of 1st half

Predictions: 
(1) Lebron will be the 1st on the bench...will close quarters/begin quarters with bench unit
(2)Troy Brown will be 1st off the bench as backup 3 to Lebron
(3) Rui will be back in rotation as backup 4 to Vanderbilt
(4) Beasley will be in rotation and close quarters with Lebron on the floor
(5)Lonnie Walker will be out of rotation
(6)Gabriel will not tandem with AD...just be used in spot minutes end of 1st/3rd&gt;&gt;beginning of 2nd/4th
(7) expect Reaves to be in closing lineups with DLo, AD, Lebron
(8)Brown/Vanderbilt will be 5th man in closing lineups based on matchups...

most importantly Lakers need consistent substitution pattern...players need to find the rhythm of getting consistent minutes within substitution pattern...
