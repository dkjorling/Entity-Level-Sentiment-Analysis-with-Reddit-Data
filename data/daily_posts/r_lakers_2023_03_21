4/5 - LAC (if PG injury is bad he may miss this game)

4/7 - Suns (only game I think we may be playing a ‚Äúbetter‚Äù team if KD is back. If Bron is back too we will need to beat them to prove we are A legit playoff team)

He wants $10M a year deal. Lakers should be able to lure him with the pitch of a starting role. He‚Äôs a great rim protector and he‚Äôs a pretty good 3 point shooting big. He‚Äôs super young so he‚Äôll only get better in these areas. He‚Äôd be the perfect center to pair with AD. 

Starters 

PG: LeBron James

SG: D‚ÄôAngelo Russell

SF: Jarred Vanderbilt

PF: Anthony Davis

C: Naz Reid

Spacing isn‚Äôt great, but idc. This defense would be historic.

Luckily there seems to be doubt on Ayton playing tomorrow which is good because the last thing we need is a center killing us. And when we play the thunder on friday, there's a good chance Shai is out because he's listed in injury protocol to not play in back to back games (unless they rest him thursday).

If we manage to do this we'll be at 500 with hopefully momentum into the following games before LBJ returns.",1.0

He has a 16/10 game and y‚Äôall are very quick to say he had a ‚Äúbad‚Äù day and should be traded or whatever. Do you even realize what he does defensively? The Houston loss for example. AD could‚Äôve gone out there and put up 0 points and we would win that game purely because of his defense. Some of you need to realize that stats are not everything.,1.0
23,2023-03-21 20:01:44,11xsirw,Can we stop pretending that Malik Beasley is a good shooter?,Tobio-Star,"Brickley was shooting 35% from 3 on 10+FGA playing for the f\*cking Jazz.

He has one good game draining 6-7 threes and follows that up with 5-6 games of being complete garbage.

It doesn‚Äôt even have to do with LA‚Äôs pressure: dude is shooting less than 38% from 3 for his career. What true sniper is below 38% over their CAREER?

The eye test shows he is an okay shooter at best: he misses wide open shots badly and holds his follow through all the time

A real shooter is someone like Buddy Hield or Bojan. Those guys make their shots no matter if wide open or even triple teamed at times. Pelinka really should have tried harder to get one of those guys (not taking any shots at him btw). Beasley is only hitting his shots in garbage time or when the whole team is cooking ie in pressure less situations. 

The coach should give all of his minutes to Lonnie and hand him DNPs unless someone is hurt or something",1.0

Cause this starters are trash right now, even with AD and his struggling offense right now (also this coaching staff is not involving him in ton of plays) and DLo cause i expect big scoring from him. 

Props to the bench cause of Rui with his midrange magic, Dennis enjoying scoring off the bench like he used to, Wenyen with all the energy in the world and AR wuth everything he have. 

I think AR should start now cause next game is against Booker and Beasley is trash right now especially with Bron out. Still think Bron can get him out of this slump but we dont have Bron right now so starting AR might be a better choice than waiting for Beasley to shoot 5 threes and make none. Darvin Ham dont need to be patient with him cause its not the start of the season any more, its not mid season anymore.",1.0
