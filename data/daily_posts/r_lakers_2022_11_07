And yes, I know Lebron and AD pushed for the trade, but part of your job is to grow some balls and stand up to your players. He clearly has the backing of the front office so I don‚Äôt know why he caved in so easily? Also in hindsight, that Buddy Hield trade he had lined up was pretty bad as well. Move the two first round picks I don‚Äôt give a flying fuck about the 2029 pick, that‚Äôs a seventh grader right now. Kid probably ain‚Äôt even have his first kiss yet and the Lakers are wasting Bron‚Äôs twilight years for him. Trade Russ and the two picks for Myles and Buddy. If it doesn‚Äôt work then Danny Ainge this shit and trade Bron AD Myles and Buddy for a bunch of picks.

- AD looked really good tonight, he was decisive and strong on offense and a force on defense. I thought he did a decent job on Markennan. He still has it when we prioritize him on offense. 

- Russ looked solid as well honestly. His burst seemed to still be present, the finishing was pretty iffy and the jumper was atrocious. The decision making on offense and defense was questionable as usual, but he played with force. 

- My biggest surprise was seeing that Austin Reaves was clearly the 3rd best player for us. He battled on D, made smart decisions in transition and drove hard to the basket and drew fouls. 

- Damien Jones, Wenyan Gabriel, and Matt Ryan do not belong in any NBA rotation other than being 11th or 12th men. Overall I don‚Äôt believe all is lost if we make a trade. I know that‚Äôs a belief that is dying out but they really looked good in the first half. I just don‚Äôt trust Pelinka to make the right moves.

Whether it is medical statistics, political, statistics, or sports statistics, I just love crunching numbers. I also love watching basketball and playing it.

I gotta say, I don‚Äôt hate this team. As much as I hated let‚Äôs say, the 2014 Lakers. However, I find this seem to be very inefficient to say the least.

I think that this squad has some potential to grow how much potential can they really readjust? 

So the above picture is the stats that I gave the Lakers on NBA 2K 23 made by yours truly. I have about 16 years of experience adjusting rosters and it‚Äôs one of my extremely boring and mundane and hobbies (FR3AKYD on XB). 

-	 Anthony Davis has been a low 80 ever since we won the championship. He has top-five DPOY numbers, but some of the worst offense at the power/center position in the NBA, at least, for starters. How much more room does this guy have to sort of return to what he once was in 2020? What about who he was in New Orleans? Is this the Davis that we are now going to have to expect? A top-five defensive talent with below average offense missing 20 to 30 games a year? 
-	LeBron is in my opinion potentially the biggest reason why we are playing so bad. I don‚Äôt think I have ever seen LeBron this low ever since I started playing basketball related video games. I started back in 2006 and I got to tell you‚Ä¶ This is very worrying. He‚Äôs playing absolutely‚Ä¶ Regular. And that‚Äôs the problem at the age of 38 and year 20. I don‚Äôt really see how much more he can turn this up but if there ever was a player to do it, it would be him I just feel the need to remind everybody that after the ‚Äò95/96 NBA season, a noticeable downward trend, began to hit Jordan. It was even more evident in the 98 season. I think we are now witnessing LeBron‚Äôs significant decline as he has been dropping every single season since 2020.
-	It‚Äôs good to see Russell Westbrook play the best basketball he has played since he was on the Rockets. I still feel that he is extremely inefficient with his 32% assist percentage and a 20% turnover rate percentage. However, he was playing a decent amount better than he was last season, and he is potentially playing the best defense of his entire career!
-	A lot of players on this team are playing some outstanding defense and shooting absolute diarrhea out there. Shout outs to Reeves, Beverly, Gabriel, and Jones. They‚Äôre doing something right while also doing something really wrong. Hopefully they work it out.
-	The final point I will make is what the fuck happened to Kendrick Nunn. I don‚Äôt think I have ever seen a more disappointing player projection than this guy. I literally saw this motherfucker was one step away from becoming a solid, NBA starter‚Ä¶ A pure shooting point guard. Nope. The man has dropped off from what I thought was a 77 back in 2020 to a 66 today. The man would basically just be a role player in the G league at this point.",1.0

Covering the Cavs is pretty easy at this point; you basically just have to copy and paste.¬†**Donovan Mitchell**¬†scored 33, the rest of the squad contributed to a balanced attack, and they used a big run to win convincingly.

Yep, sounds familiar.

For LA,¬†**Russell Westbrook**¬†looks great in his newly-assigned role coming off the bench (19 &amp; 10 in this one), but the team just does not have enough shooting to stay in games if they fall behind.",1.0

If their record gets so bad it might not even be worth trying to change things. That or the uphill climb will be too hard to reach.

Is Ham just getting out-coached in these third quarters, or are we over time just reverting to our mean (aka being cakes)? üòÜ

99,2022-11-07 17:12:28,yotgt7,Dr. Jerry Buss Owned the Lakers for 34 Years. They Missed the Playoffs Twice... Went to 16 NBA Finals and Won 10...,EnergyFax,"In his 34 years as owner of the Lakers, his teams went to the NBA Finals a ridiculous 16 times and won 10 NBA championships. Under Buss the lakers missed the playoffs ONLY TWO TIMES!

Since his death the lakers have missed the playoffs 7 times in the span of 9 Years.

Dr. Jerry Buss ran his organization through a simple formula: hire the best, most talented people and get the hell out of their way.

Bringing in legendary basketball minds, such as Bill Sharman, Jerry West, Phil Jackson and Mitch Kupchak, and bestowing them with all the authority necessary to make decisions has been Buss' key to successful management over the past three and half decades.

His trust fund baby kids run the lakers like some sick nepotism work shop, something you would see from a horror comedy. His kids grew up welthy and privileged and know nothing about hard work and pride.

The lack of humility before nature that's being displayed here, uh... staggers me. With his kids taking over I thought things would be bit different but nothing I had to fear... But they ended up being a lot worse. Don't you see the danger here guys inherent in what They're doing? Ownership power is the most awesome force the planet's ever seen, but they have been wielding it like a kid that's found his dad's gun. If I may... Um, I'll tell you the problem with the ownership power that they're using here, it didn't require any discipline to attain it. They were gifted the team through there fathers death with no discipline to attain it. They didn't earn the knowledge for themselves, so they don't take any responsibility for it. They stood on the shoulders of legends to accomplish something as fast as they could, and before they even knew what they had, they patented it, and packaged it, and slapped it on a plastic lunchbox, and now they're selling it, they wanna sell it. Well... I don't think they deserve any credit for the 2020 chip. The buss kids have done things which nobody's ever done before... they were so preoccupied with whether or not they could that they didn't stop to think if they should!",1.0
