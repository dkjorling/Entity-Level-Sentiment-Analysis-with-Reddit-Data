GSW have 4 games remaining, 3 on the road, and they aren't a good road team. They play DEN, OKC (home), SAC, POR.

Clips only 3 games remaining, 1 on the road. They play us, POR, PHX (road). 

Pelicans also have a very tough schedule and we have tiebreaker on them. 

Assuming these teams won't go perfect and we somehow go 5-0, we would end up with the 5th seed and play PHX 1st round.",1.0

Also possible, but out of our control, if GS loses just 1 game and we win out, we have the 5th seed (tiebreaker baby), and the opportunity to kick KD and the bitch-ass Suns out in the first round.

19,2023-04-01 22:36:18,12919rh,Today's games,yggerg,"**Dallas Mavericks vs Miami Heat**

This is gonna be almost too painful to watch them defend each other, with Bam Adebayo and Kyle Lowry out tonight. For Mavs only Ntilikina is out.

Asking Kevin Love to take much of the frontcourt responsibilities is too much of an ask at this point in his career. Hoping Luka explodes over a BS call and gets that 16th T at any point before the final game of the season.

Still hoping for a Mavs loss.

**Los Angeles Clippers vs New Orleans Pelicans**

Already posted in this sub. Nothing much to say. I want this game to be a war. I hope this game reaches 8 overtimes. 

I'm on the side of playing safe so I want a Pelicans loss here. Just want to give Lakers some separation from those below while still having a shotnat 6th seed.

That said, hopefully everything turns out again in Lakers favor after today, and LFG as always.",1.0

38,2023-04-01 16:47:10,128rprl,Job's not finished: An overview of our place in the standings,FreshMctendies,"We are currently the seventh seed. We have five games left. Needless to say, we need to win out the rest of the games to ensure we're in the playoffs and at least in the play-in. Let's look at the best case and worst case scenarios. **Both are unlikely as we'll probably end up somewhere in between.**

**The best case scenario:** We win all five remaining games and end with a record of 44-38. This can place us as high as 4th in the standings if literally all the teams above us lose out.  

**The worst case scenario:** We lose all five remaining games and end with a record of 39-43. This can place us as a low as 12th standings and out of the play-in tournament. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Next three games:**

**04/02 - Lakers at Rockets**

The Rockets are 3-7 in their last ten. We lost the last game because we had no size. Bron, AD, and Bamba were out. The Rockets put up 78 points in the paint to our measly 46. We shot 25% from three, with Russell at 3-11 and Beasley with 4-12. Reaves was our highest scorer with 24, but struggled as well with 6-14 from the field and 1-7 from three. We have Bron and AD back. This should be a W.  

&amp;#x200B;

**04/04 - Lakers at Jazz** 

The Jazz are 4-6 in their last ten. We lost the last game against them in November, 116-139. We lost due to zero defensive cohesion and no Bron. Russ was -23 for the game. AD only grabbed 4 boards. We are a vastly better defensive team now and have Bron back. This should be a W.

&amp;#x200B;

**04/05 - Lakers at Clippers**

The Clippers are 6-4 in their last ten. We have lost every Clippers game since July 2020. We lost the last game against them in January, 115-133. We lost due to no size (no AD). Bryant was our starting center and Gabriel was only given 14 minutes. This loss was even worse than the score. We went 40% from three with Bron putting up an absurd 9-14 from range. With AD back, we can use their lack of big depth against them. We should pressure Plumlee and get him in foul trouble.  Considering this is a back to back game, I wouldn't be surprised if we rested AD and gave this one up.",1.0

Lakers get a HUGEEE win the biggest game of the season against the Timberwolves to move to the 7th seed in the west. AD with a MONSTER 38 and 17(against 2 7 footers) to lead the team. Big shoutout to Dennis and Rui for coming in off the bench to play great defense .

It feels weird to say but the month Lebron missed might end up being a turning point in AD's Lakers career because i feel like that's when the team finally leant how to win with AD being the best player on the floor. When he is this dominant on offence there isn't a player that can dominate the game on both ends of the floor like he can. 

Job's not finished though we have 3 more games on the revenge tour coming up vs the Rockets, Jazz and Clippers, so lets go beat all those teams.

A 3-1 night on last night's rooting guide with the Thunder, Jazz and Clippers all losing and even though the Spurs stayed though they couldn't beat the Warriors. Today is another important day with 2 games on the slate.

**Rooting Guide.**

1. **Heat(-2)** over the Mavericks
2. **Clippers(+2.5)** over the Pelicans

Still over the moon from last night, but it's important to still realize that there's work to be done. Get some rest today, hopefully AD's ankle doesn't get worse over night, and hope the team load up on vitamin C and ginger tea because the Wolves were spreading their germs all over last night.
