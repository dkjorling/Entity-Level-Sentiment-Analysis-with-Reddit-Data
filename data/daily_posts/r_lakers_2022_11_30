With how things stand currently, he can‚Äôt be the one running the ball down the court and playing good defense. It‚Äôs one or the other.

Ham needs to find ways to conserve his energy on the court so we don‚Äôt have his energy expended on defense.

I'm a huge UCLA basketball fan. When WB came out of UCLA and entered the draft, I labeled him fools gold, all the way back then. I know that too many people get enamored w/ athleticism, over bBallIQ. It's taken maybe 20+ years before the NBA has finally been catching up the fact that you need high bBallIQ players and great outside shooters to win championships. You can't win championships w/ key players that have epically low BballIQ's... it just doesn't happen... ever.

&amp;#x200B;

When given enough of a sample size, +/- combined w/ PER are great general overall stat indicators of a players value when on the court. 

Westbrook this year = -36

Reaves this year = +25

================================

Westbrook last year = -211

Reaves last year = +54

&amp;#x200B;

This isn't another dump on Russ post. I hope it's more educational in the sense of you don't need to have insane dunks, speed, or athleticism. What you need to be a valuable basketball player is UNDERSTAND the fking game and learn how to play smart! 

If you currently play HS basketball or at whatever level, my advice as a former bball coach is - understand and study the games of high BballIQ players. The little things that are done either correctly, or incorrectly add up on the court over time. It's setting the correct screen, running to the correct open space, making the correct angle pass, etc.. Understand the game... study it like Kobe did, and you'll go far, no matter what your current level of athleticism is.",1.0

53,2022-11-30 19:35:05,z90ttv,Jovan Buha places some blame on Darvin Ham. Do you agree?,Bussin_Out,"TLDR: advanced stats suggest the lakers are at their worst with Westbrook in the closing lineup. Should he still be in the lineup? How to make it work if he is? If not, what‚Äôs the alternative?


Jovan Buha appeared on Lakers Talk with Allen Sliwa and he puts some of the blame on Ham for not establishing a pecking order in terms of who gets shots. He wonders if Ham is just trying to appease Westbrook by having him in crunch time moments.  He says there was too much Westbrook in that 4th quarter Pacers collapse by pointing out it was lot of Westbrook and AD PNRs that ended up with Westbrook taking shots he shouldn‚Äôt be taking. He also said Westbrook shouldn‚Äôt be in crunch time lineups due to  bad decision making. He stated Westbrook has tendency to look for his own shot and take the bait from defenses by taking shots he shouldn‚Äôt. He says it has hurt the team this season and last. 

The Locked on Lakers podcast hosts echoed these sentiments in that Westbrook shouldn‚Äôt be closing games due to poor decision making with added poor defense. They shared it‚Äôs highlighted in the Pacers loss but I still believe everyone contributed to the collapse ( [here‚Äôs a thread on that](https://twitter.com/rajchipalu/status/1597491971681316864?s=46&amp;t=rfGfq00QMnjskrrCt0Jqjw)) They also looked at advanced stats of the big 3 in 4th quarters on the season. 

AD is -4.9
Lebron is -9.4
Westbrook is -26.3

This begs the question. Should Westbrook play in the 4th quarter? If so, how do they make it work? If not, who should be in the closing lineup instead?",1.0

FO would still like to find a Russ trade but there's nothing out there they would give up 2 1st for and they are still not planning on using both 1st to get off 1 player.

Lonnie Walker is unlikely to get traded but it's not something he will rule out based off the mid range salary that he has. And the team likes his role and replacing Monk.",0.87
