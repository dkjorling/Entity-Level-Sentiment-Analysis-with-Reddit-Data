PG: Schroeder

SG: Lonnie Walker

SF: LeBron

PF: AD

C: Damian Jones

2nd Unit

6: Russ

7:  Reaves

8: Troy Brown 

9: Wenyen Gabriel

10: Thomas Bryant

I would move Nunn, Beverly &amp; Juan Tuscano for a better shooter to replace Troy Brown in the lineup. I honestly think the team has a lot of potential. I love the energy that second unit brings into the game. I would start Damian Jones because I believe he is solid enough to support the other starters and would allow Thomas Bryant to make a bigger impact off the bench.  What do you guys think?",1.0

Well, what do you know now - this team is improving. Reaves has been excellent. 

And Dennis and Thom have really made a difference for this squad. This team is actually deep now. Dennis gives us scoring punch we sorely needed.

If LeBron and AD continue to stay relatively healthy, this is a playoff team.

Myles Turner would be invested with draft picks and long term salary cap space to be essentially a backup center to AD...you can not have upwards of 70 million in cap space invested in two centers...what made Dwight &amp; McGee such a great fit was how well they produced vs what you were paying them...combined Dwight and McGee didn't even make 10 million...Myles Turner is gonna demand like 25 million a year...

it would actually make alot more basketball sense to trade AD for Myles Turner and Buddy Hield...then you couod use the Westbrook contract in another trade...I don't think Lakers will go that far but not making that Indiana trade was a prudent decision by Rob Pelinka...",1.0

This team needs at least one solid 2 way young athletic wing that can guard the others best player and contribute and offense. The Myles Turner/ Hield trade would be okay but not ideal because it would turn AD into that wing and help with size overall but it seems like that is not happening anytime soon.,1.0

The total damage? $992.
