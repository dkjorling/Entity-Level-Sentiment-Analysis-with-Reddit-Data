20,2023-02-21 12:35:31,1182f1l,I‚Äôm so hyped up for Mo‚Äôs potential man,chalkbro,"Mo Bamba seems like he could be our next franchise cornerstone with how good he is. In my opinion, he‚Äôs got Dikembe Mutumbo-like shot blocking abilities with prime Rudy Gobert rim protection. His motor is one of the highest in the league (look how amped up he was in 16 minutes in his Laker debut). With the right pieces around him, I believe he is first team all-defense next season. His defensive metrics are off the charts with how good he is. His active hands on defense always has him creating headaches for opponents when he slashes the ball away from them. 

He could very well be the best shooting big man in the entire NBA. It wouldn‚Äôt be surprising to see him hit shots like Robert Horry in a big playoff series. He has virtually unlimited range from deep and does not hesitate to pull the trigger. With a 7‚Äô10‚Äù wingspan, he is also a massive threat to slam lobs and play down low, where he loves to bang bodies and grab offensive boards. This frees up AD to do what he wants, while Mo does the dirty work. He reminds me of a better shooting Joel Embiid on defense m. 

My guess is he starts alongside LeBron, Davis, and Russell to create one of the greatest Big 4s the game has ever seen. I could see him finishing out the year as a 22/12/3/3/3 guy.",1.0

22,2023-02-21 08:06:54,117y4rn,"I think it's time to put a slash on the Daily Discussion Thread from ""Three Guard Lineups"" to ""New Look Lakers""",LALakers4Lyf,"Currently, Schroder and Pippen Jr. are our only players below 6'4"", and one of them is on a two-way contract.

We can get away with playing multiple guards this time because they're all threats from 3 (and are between 6'4"" and 6'6"" in height), and even then it'll most likely be situational because we're finally deep on the wings. 

I think we're still lacking one more big man so that AD can play PF more often, but that feels like less of a need now since we have a true backup big (Bamba) and multiple big forwards in LeBron, Rui, Vanderbilt, and Wenyen",1.0
