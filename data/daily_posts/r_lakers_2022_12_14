That‚Äôs not that far away. This front office has showed him nothing but incompetence since the championship, and there‚Äôs no real sign anything‚Äôs gonna change. If I‚Äôm AD, or any NBA player really, I‚Äôm staying the fuck away from this organization. Unless there‚Äôs a miraculous turnaround in the next couple months, or perhaps we somehow manage to turn things around next year, AD‚Äôs gone and I don‚Äôt have much doubt about it.

After AD‚Ä¶ what‚Äôs next? There are very few stars, let alone superstars, who want to come here anymore. We already know that almost no coaches want to come here after the Frank Vogel situation, and players aren‚Äôt just turning a blind eye to our front office‚Äôs blatant incompetence.

I made a post a while back saying we are in serious danger of becoming like the Knicks and got flamed to shit over it because you hiveminded zealots couldn‚Äôt understand what I was saying, instead blurting out ‚Äúdurrr they have no rings since the 70s durrr‚Äù. What I was saying in this post was that we are becoming the big money organization that will attract a big name every once in a blue moon, but never win anything because our front office is full of people who don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre doing. Regardless of what we USED to be, this is who we are very possibly GOING TO be.

That is exactly the point we‚Äôre approaching. Once LeBron and probably AD are gone‚Ä¶ what‚Äôs left? The difference between us and the Knicks for so long was while we‚Äôre both big markets, we are known for success while they are known for wasting talent, hence why we still attracted big names more than they did, but now we don‚Äôt even have that. Oh and on top of that we‚Äôre growing a reputation of being cheap, so one more reason for guys to go to the Knicks instead.

The Lakers are one of very few sports organizations that had what I call an extended dynasty. This is where a front office is so good that they manage to cycle through multiple smaller dynasties with minimal turnaround. Us and the Celtics are really the only 2 franchises to do this, and none to the extent we did. The thing with this, however, is that the Lakers name isn‚Äôt the factor here, it was the consistent genius by the front office that got us where we were, and that‚Äôs gone. 

When Anthony Davis leaves, it might genuinely be over for this franchise as one of the greats.",1.0

He has been good so far this season just sometimes feels like he has the tendency to not try and do too much or hold back &amp; let Bron, AD, and Russ carry which is understandable but in situations like last night where those 3 have nothing left the team needs him to take shots. I know Russ is the primary ball handler in the 2nd unit I just wish he was giving more opportunity to run the offense and not play off ball so much. 

Regardless tho I‚Äôve been really happy with his improvement in his 2nd season so far and excited to see him grow ands keep improving because he has been one of the few bright spots of the season.üíØ",1.0

The mistake has been made. He's not worth the money. Better to get whatever you can for him now while he has ANY trade value at all and try to make the Lakers make the playoffs.  


I'm not even saying he's an awful player but he definitely does not help the Lakers win games. IMO, he's worthless on the Lakers but may have some value to another team.

LeBron should also be taking better ""clutch shots"", at least put himself in a position to possibly make a big shot, not just settling for contested moving 3s when there is plenty of time on the shot clock. 

Westbrook also shouldn't be in at late game, it's so obvious teams don't even try to defend him and he is gladly obliging by taking jumpers and i'm not surprised at every single missed jumpers from him last night.

Russ is just horrible. His defense is bad, he can‚Äôt finish at the rim, he can‚Äôt shoot free throws, he can‚Äôt shoot midranges, can‚Äôt shoot the 3 and has the IQ of a fucking frog. Now you may ask, well what does he fucking do? Well, you know he can sometimes pass the ball pretty good, BUT his passes do come with A LOT of turnovers. 

Describing this player, you‚Äôd think he‚Äôd be out of the league, but he‚Äôs actually on our team making 47M AND closing our games. Teams are literally putting their center on Russ. He should simply not touch the floor in the 4th. Let him get some run in while AD and Bron rests, that‚Äôs it. As the 4th comes around, his ass stays on the bench.

I know he‚Äôs working with what he‚Äôs got, but there are games with questionable rotations and there are games with above average decisions. 

He hasn‚Äôt been shy to sub Russ out to close a game during nights that Russ struggles the first 3 quarters, I‚Äôll give him that, but he has not been consistent with it either. 

During our comeback tonight and before our 13pt lead, when we first got an 8 point lead, Ham signaled both LeBron and AD to take a breather and both of them said no. This led to us extending the lead by 5 more points with the consequence of LeBron and AD just being totally gassed. After seeing how much LeBron has been getting gassed with the extended mins, I feel like he should have forced them to sit for a minute (not at the same time). I know we were making a crazy run but adrenaline gets the best of the players up until they can‚Äôt play defense anymore. At that point as the coach, you can‚Äôt let the hype of the game get to you, every single min makes a difference when you only have 2 guys to rely on the whole game to get buckets.
