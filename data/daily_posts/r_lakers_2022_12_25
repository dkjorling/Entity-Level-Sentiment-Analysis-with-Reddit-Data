The 3rd quaters are a coaches fault and even then the coaches and players are not put in a position to have a good game from the start because of this construction. This front office is so pathetic its honestly amazing

&amp;#x200B;

Keep those picks because honestly at a certain point the lakers brand and name will simply mean nothing if they cannot attract stars.  This is just a bad look, you cannot surround ad and bron with the right piece is yucky but w.e see yall next season . The five guard line up was a call for help this season is ova",1.0

2,2022-12-26 04:47:41,zvfat2,"Even if you think the season is lost, we should still clean house on the guards",suhar97,"The trio of Beverly, Nunn, and Westbrook is the source of all of our woes 

1) awful fits given the size, lack of 2 way presence, lack of consistent outside shooting 

2) relative to each of their contracts, they are all underperforming and they are 3 of the 4 non-vet min, non-Bron / AD players 

Point 2 is critical when you add in an injured AD (max cap slot). This boils down to Lebron playing with a vet min roster and guys performing under relative to their contracts. The development of a guy like AR very partially can offset a fraction of this issue, but it is clearly not enough. When AD was healthy, he is the freak type of player that also helps to offset this issue. Right now, the ship is sinking

Now, even if you believe the season is cooked, there is a case to be made to clean house of these 3: continuity

These 3 would be ~65m of expiring salary, and would be enough to restock the cupboard with 3-4 quality role players. This requires moving both picks inevitably (more on that below)

Contrast this with letting them expire and maybe you have ~30m in cap and get 1-2 guys? You end up with another deficient roster with now hardly any moveable deals, as the lakers suck on the margins with bird rights. Yes you may have a 3rd pick to use, but russ‚Äô contract is the best vehicle of replenishing the roster at 47m. Without it, those 3 picks become far harder to consolidate into immediate value

Trading the 3 allows you to build a mini core for at minimum this year and next. Championship rosters are not assembled over night and the 2020 team was the exception, not the rule. So even if you think this year is cooked, you allow ad and Bron to mesh with this hypothetical set of role players and see what they can do this year and buckle down for next year.

In the most upside case, the roller players you trade for now see increase in value and down the line before a rebuild you can firesale and recoup your assets that you invested right now",1.0

Then again in 2022 summer chasing Kyrie while Jerami Grant, Brogdon and Bogdanovic went for peanuts. Get at least two of those, Lakers are a legit contender now. 

And as of now, it seems like unless they won't trade away both the picks unless it's for a star level player.

I follow the Lakers when i can because the chase for Kareem is huge, and it will be monumental when lebron gets there.

But it is clear to me that lebron is only chasing that record.   There is not a lot of effort on lebrons part in leading or putting the effort into the small things that are necessary to win games.  To be honest, the Lakers are a hard team to watch (sorry).

The franchise really is in limbo until lebron gets that record.

Until that time, the most entertaining aspect of the Lakers is austin reaves imo. He is fun to watch because he needs to be creative to make up for his lack of athleticism.  I can't speak to AD because he is mostly injured. You can't entertain sitting on the bench.  When Reaves gets taken off the court, I instinctively start to channel surf for another game.   He is the only thing that makes watching the Lakers play, tolerable.

My question is, does Lakers Nation appreciate Reaves as much as I do?",1.0

To keep this team as 'playoffs' caliber team, AD needs to play majority of games which will cause him an injury for some reason.

And the reason why our defense shit is bc our team is full of guards. For wings, we have lebron, JTA(injured), Gabriel(Cant shoot), and thats it. Not a single wing besides lebron who can shoot or score by themselves.

I think there's a lot of misinformation floating around for whatever reason. But below I tried to clarify our situation as best as possible going forward. 


**Future Draft Picks**

|2024|LAL* (1)|WAS or MEM (1)|

||||
||**6 total over 7 years**|7 total over 7 years|
||||
||* NOP can choose either 2024 or 2025 pick, LAL keeps the opposite||

**Stepien Rule**

Due to the [Stepien Rule](https://basketball.realgm.com/article/249279/CBA-Encyclopedia-Stepien-Rule) we can currently only trade the 2027 and 2029 first round picks. A team can not trade away all of their future first round picks in two consecutive drafts. See the comments for more detailed explanation. (u/Awesomefan09 and u/Zodraz)


**Future Salary Cap**

|**Year**|**No. of players**|**Est. Cap Hit**|
:--|:--|:--|
|2023-24|4*|$91.7 mil|
|2024-25|2**|$93.8 mil|
|2025-26|0|$0|
|2026-27|0|$0|
|2027-28|0|$0|
|2028-29|0|$0|
|2029-30|0|$0|
||||
||* Jones is a Player Option||
||** James and Davis are player options||

Long story short, we have pretty good draft coverage, effectively only missing one first round pick over the next 7 years. And on the salary cap side, we have no long term 'bad' contracts, so we have flexibility there as well. 

Obviously this all depends on our front office making good decisions, which most seem skeptical of. But I do want to remind everyone that we generally have good scouting. And we had really good rosters in both 19-20 and 20-21, before the Westbrook trade. The Westbrook trade is really the only major black eye, imo. No, Caruso is not worth paying $30 mil in luxury taxes on, sorry, and I say that absolutely loving the guy. 

Personally, I don't think the the future is bleak, I think we've done a good job ensuring that we can rebuild once LeBron retires.
