But you guys seem to have forgotten LeBron is out and people are chasing after Beasley every game, so while he doesn't make the same amount of threes, it leaves one of our guys open.

The Kings haven‚Äôt made the playoffs in however many years and this is the first time in ages that they‚Äôve had a winning record. Ok, so what? That‚Äôs like if a business was losing thousands of dollars a month and hired a new manager and ‚Äúturned things around‚Äù to where the business was now profiting one dollar per month. And everyone started beating the band talking about how he was the businessman of the year. That‚Äôs Mike Brown right now. Everyone seems to want to reward him just for having a base level of competency that his predecessors lacked.

Darvin Ham is cool under fire. It is incredibly refreshing to see a coach who isn‚Äôt a hot headed lunatic. You never see him berating his guys or flying off the handle yelling at the officials. I really think there is something to be said about a coach who offers that level of poise, which I think has rubbed off on the team. That sort of attitude is critical in late game situations, where getting too fired up and mistaking fury for passion leads to sloppy playing. I believe the Lakers still being in a position to make the playoffs is at least partially owed to the grace of Darvin Ham.",1.0
