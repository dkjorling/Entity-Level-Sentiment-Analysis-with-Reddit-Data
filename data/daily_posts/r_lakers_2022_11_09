It seems like LeBron stood little to lose by utilizing said leverage, and I have to imagine Jeannie would have acquiesced to his request?  

Why make a leap of faith on the twilight of your career for a FO that you knew has a high chance of demonstrating poor asset management? 

Obviously LeBron can‚Äôt really change the fact that Jeannie is cheap and doesn‚Äôt wanna pay Lux tax, but it seems like he could have exerted more influence over the FO at the very least.

Lakers are taking the spotlight right now because we are the biggest team and have the worst record. With how shit other teams are playing, we could be somewhat 'competitive'. Remember we had the hardest schedule the first 10 games.

For example, the mavs have started off hot but just lost to the magic without banchero. Luka been avg 36 but that isnt sustainable. The warriors have been trash despite beating us. I would argue they have performed the worst considering the schedule they had. The timberwolves are 5-6 right now. Pelicans are 5-5. They are 3 wins away from us and we've been horrible. The clippers and nuggets look effy considering they were the favorites to win the west. Also, the blazers are 7-3 right now and i'm not buying into that. Considering how close their games are and the roster they have, they are outperforming their record.

What i'm saying is its a long season and anything can happen. Go lakers we about to drop the flippers!",0.48

Has a nice 3pt shoot, can create his own shot and is able to get to the line. Has already some nba experience, didn't have really a chance to prove himself being picked by the nets two years prior. He is not the best defensive player but does it matter with the current roster construction, someone like Lebron would probably bring out the best out of him.

82,2022-11-09 20:13:36,yqu6au,When will fans start chanting ‚ÄúSell The Team‚Äù?,CM_Punkerton,"I understand that it may not work in the most literal sense, but it would be good to bring attention to it on a mainstream level. ESPN would cover it immediately the next morning and create a new narrative that the problem is the front office, which has already been marinating for a while. 

Look at what‚Äôs happening with the Washington Commanders, fans are chanting to sell amidst the rumors of several potential buyers, and it‚Äôs looking like it may happen. Whose to say that it couldn‚Äôt work again?

I‚Äôm not looking at ownership being a problem in the current year, even though it is, but it being a continuous problem 25+ years or so down the line. Of course that sounds drastic, but when you look at the teams lack of success since the passing of Dr. Jerry Buss, it looks grim for the future. 

Look at LeBron‚Äôs years as a Laker:

2018-19: 4th seed before injury, miss the playoffs
2019-20: Win Championship
2020-21: Win Play In, Lose in first round to red hot Suns team
2021-22: Miss Playoffs
2022-23: You are here (2-8 as of writing) 

The success with LeBron, despite a championship, has been underwhelming. This isn‚Äôt his fault at all, as he‚Äôs played LeBron basketball every year and has always been consistent. You can make a lot of ‚Äúthey would have‚Äù scenarios in your head, but the fact is we‚Äôve only been to one Finals with LeBron, and only twice to the playoffs. Compare that to Miami, and both stints in Cleveland, where LeBron was always in the playoffs, and had 8 consecutive Finals visits. What the Lakers have given LeBron is unforgivable, and it provides a negative side to the franchise that free agents wouldn‚Äôt like to look at. 

Toward the end of Kobe‚Äôs play, ESPN had those segments about the idea that nobody wanted to play with Kobe. I think it‚Äôs becoming more clear that it wasn‚Äôt a Kobe issue, it was a Lakers issue. 

I‚Äôm an optimist, and I always feel like it‚Äôll turn out right for us in the end, but I think we need to use our voice to maybe not bring an end to a regime, but to tell the office that we need more respect.",1.0
