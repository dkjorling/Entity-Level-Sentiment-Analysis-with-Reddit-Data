No shade, no street clothes mockery.

But just based on his absence to start this year, his rocky return, and recent quotes, I think were fucked and we werd always going to be fucked. He has been one of the most unreliable players in lakers history when it comes to health. He is also a champion. 

But here right now when we need to go on a big run just to grab the ten seed - how in the mother fucking Seabiscuit cocaine tiddlywinks can you trust this hung man?

Lakers manage to bring 5 guys who's serviceable and make this team atleast a play-in tournament team. On paper, the Lakers are now a good 3pt shooting team. Its up to Ham to make this work with him now having shooters that can expand his plays.

CHEMISTRY is one of the big factors that helped the Lakers on their last Championship run. That roster was having dinners, taco tuesdays, party and have hang most times. That team was fun. I think that Javale Mcgee, Jared Dudley, and Rajon Rondo have been instrumental in creating that chemistry within the locker room, on the court and off the court. With Russel Westbrook out of the roster, the big elephant in the room is now nowhere to be found and trade rumors is over, the player must now eye on finishing strong.

11,2023-02-11 03:29:35,10zb0w1,AD + Bamba Line-Ups,BlueRaj,"Our front court has improved drastically from earlier this season. We’ve gone from Lebron/AD/Wenyen/TB/JTA to Lebron/AD/Vanderbilt/Rui/Bamba/Wenyen. 

Lebron and Rui both are 3/4s and we ideally shouldn’t have to see ANY minutes of them at the 5. 

Bamba is a true 5. He’s a legit 7 footer with an insane wingspan who can block shots and protect the paint at least better than TB could. On offense he spaces the floor for us too at the 5.

AD has played almost exclusively the 5 for us this season, but with the addition of Bamba, I’d like to see him a little more in that 4 role that he was in next to Javale/Dwight for at least a couple of minutes. AD at the 5 sometimes has him contest a shot, and since he’s contesting, we don’t have a big to crash the glass. Bamba is a big body so AD can do his thing defensively without worrying as much about giving up the board. Plus he can still effectively be the 5 on offense. Even if it’s only for a couple minutes a game, I’d like to see it. Against a team like the Bucks who run Giannis and Lopez, this would be especially important.

Wenyen to me is also a 4/5 and switchy defensively. I am afraid he will get stuck at the end of the rotation.

Vanderbilt is the most unique since he’s just SO versatile defensively. He’ll likely be the 4 on offense, but defensively he can guard 3s, 4s, and even 5s. Even some guards too if needed.

Thoughts on our front court rotation? Would you like to see AD/Bamba line-ups? Who should start? Personally, I think Vanderbilt.

Although, I’d love to see Beasley at the 4! (I’m kidding someone please tell Darvin Ham I’m kidding)",1.0

&gt; “It was bothering me; it was very painful,” Davis said. “The doctor told me that I had a fracture and a bone spur in my foot. At that moment, and maybe leading into the next day, it was tough for me mentally just because of the fact that coming off last year with the injuries and coming out and having a mindset of getting back to who I want to be as a player, in that mold, and for something like this to happen was tough mentally.

It also is a more complicated injury than usual 

&gt; Davis’ injury is threefold. The bone spur fractured off the navicular bone and he’s also dealing with the stress reaction. Davis said he’d “probably” need surgery this offseason to remove the bone spur, which one doctor told Davis could’ve developed as early as college. Fractures in the navicular bone are considered a serious injury, often requiring surgery and lengthy recovery periods.

And yet, he’s still playing through games and likely trying to avoid any further damage by pacing himself at times. 

&gt; “I don’t like surgery,” he said. “I feel like, if it can be avoided, then let’s avoid it. When that became an option, I wanted to make sure I get the best understanding for me because I’m the one who has to make the decision with that.”

When the coaching staff struggled with Westbrook’s unwillingness to be held accountable for his play, Westbrook wasn’t hearing it.",kai_123,"Lots of interesting tidbits here by Amick and Buha about Lakers lock room dynamics and Westbrook's ultimate departure. Worth a read.

&gt;The situation had become untenable over the past week or so, multiple team and league sources close to the situation told The Athletic, all of whom were granted anonymity so that they could speak freely. Two sources described the situation as “toxic.” And while Lakers owner Jeanie Buss was known to be against the idea of waiving Westbrook, sources say there was a strong sense from the coaching staff that it might be necessary if no trade was forthcoming. 

&gt;Lakers coaches had grown frustrated with Westbrook’s recent behavior, and he was known to be upset with being openly mentioned in trade discussions. Both sides were ready to move on from an imperfect partnership.

&gt;Tension had been rising inside the Lakers’ locker room with James’ scoring record, the team’s inconsistency and the trade deadline looming, as demonstrated by the silent, awkward atmosphere before and after losses in New Orleans and against Oklahoma City – the latter despite James passing Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. James’ pro-Irving tweets, postgame “duh” comment in New Orleans and interview with ESPN about being disappointed in not trading for Irving added even more eyes on the Lakers’ internal dynamics.

&gt;During the second quarter of Tuesday’s 133-130 loss to the Thunder, Westbrook and assistant coach Phil Handy had a verbal confrontation on the sideline — their second in roughly a month — which eventually earned the Lakers a delay of game warning. That upset the bench and led to a more contentious argument between Westbrook and head coach Darvin Ham during intermission, as first reported by ESPN on Wednesday.

&gt;Halftime of Westbrook’s Lakers finale was an emblematic ending to his time with the franchise. Ham went, well, HAM on the entire team because of its porous defensive effort in the first half. The Lakers had given up 76 first-half points to a young Thunder team that entered play averaging just 58.1 points in every other first half of this season.

&gt;But when Ham turned his attention to Westbrook and his specific individual struggles, sources say the future Hall of Famer appeared to take it personally. As had been the case so many times before, when the coaching staff struggled with Westbrook’s unwillingness to be held accountable for his play, Westbrook wasn’t hearing it.

&gt;Ham, sources say, was upset at a number of on-court developments from the first half. But the final straw, it seems, was Westbrook’s choice to walk off the court so slowly after he was replaced late in the second quarter. For both parties, the topic of great disagreement centered on respect — or lack thereof. In the end, with the tension in the room adding to the toxicity of their environment yet again, they agreed to disagree.

&gt;From both ends of this spectrum – Westbrook’s maneuvering with Washington, James and Davis exerting their influence on the Lakers – this was a superstar-driven trade if ever there was one. It was a partnership born out of a power play, one that would ultimately prove costly to the Lakers in ways that went well beyond what they gave up in the deal (Kuzma, Harrell, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and the draft rights to Isiaah Jackson, the No. 22 pick in the 2021 draft).

&gt;Former Lakers coach Frank Vogel paid a price for the Westbrook addition, as his inability to inspire total buy-in from the future Hall of Famer was a significant factor in his April 2022 firing. Never mind that he was just 18 months removed from leading the Lakers to the storied franchise’s 17th title in the Orlando bubble.

&gt;Once James started publicly declaring that he wanted a reunion with Irving, it became clear that Westbrook’s feelings were not top of mind for the franchise centerpiece.  Everyone knew that an Irving trade with the Nets would have ended Westbrook’s Lakers tenure, with him likely going to a third team because the Nets did not want him, league sources say.

&gt;Yet James sent that conspicuously-timed tweet on Friday, sharing the eyes-wide-open emoji and a champion’s crown not long after Irving asked for a trade out of Brooklyn. The following day, when James was asked if Irving would help the Lakers, he made his view more transparently known by deeming it a ‘duh’ question. After Irving was traded to Dallas on Sunday, he told ESPN’s Michael Wilbon that he was “disappointed” the Lakers didn’t land his former running mate. Within the Lakers’ walls, there was some sympathy for the position Westbrook was put in as a result of James’ messaging, and confusion as to why James chose to use his voice in that way.
