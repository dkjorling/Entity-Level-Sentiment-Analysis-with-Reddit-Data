Now this isn‚Äôt a debate about who ranks higher all time. But instead what player has left the biggest impact on a team/city. Today, it is the Los Angeles Lakers

Are they lakers planning one doing this or are they just going to leave it empty ? If so what is the logic behind it( legit question because I may have missed an article that explains this)",1.0

Vs Suns
Vs Jazz

Lakers are 37-38


- The Pelicans have a very rough schedule coming up to end the season, all playoff teams the rest of the way for them.

Pelicans are 38-37 (Lakers have tiebreaker)

- OKC has a fairly moderate schedule.Play tanking teams like Pistons and Hornets but do play Suns, Grizz and Warriors

OKC are 37-38 (Lakers have tiebreaker)

- Mavs have sort of a difficult schedule, they‚Äôll play the 76ers, Kings, Bulls &amp; Hawks among playoff, play-in teams.

Mavs are 37-39 (Lakers don‚Äôt have tiebreaker)

I‚Äôd say if you can go 4-3 at worst the Lakers will indeed make the play-in but where in the standings remains to be seen.

It‚Äôs extremely crucial they either split the Bulls &amp; Wolves 2 game stretch or go 2-0. If you go 0-2 some major ramifications can happen.",1.0
13,2023-03-28 15:00:30,124rga0,Lakers(37-38) rooting guide 28th March 2023 Discussion,Chukxoo,"A horrendous day on the. rooting guide yesterday. The fact that all the teams we are hoping to lose somehow are playing teams deep in the tank is frustrating. Also the Bulls relaxing vs the Clippers just to go all out again tomorrow vs us is hilarious.

A 1-4 day overall with the Jazz being the only team that lost, they seem to be out of the picture finally. Other teams like the Mavs, Pelicans, Clippers and even the Timberwolves who had a tough matchup on the road to the Kings won.

Today doesn't look more prossining.

**Rooting Guide.**

1. **Hornets(+9.5)** over the Thunder
2. **Warriors(-8.5)** over the Pelicans

Big game tomorrow 

GO LAKERS!!!

14,2023-03-28 14:34:37,124qo5t,I think there's a real possibility this is a repeat of 2021,RemmiusPalaemon91,"I know this will piss people off who are used to doomer talk on here but I'm starting to have major concerns about health. Our team feels good enough to compete - unlike last year - but has multiple guys in precarious situations:

- Lebron is back but still hurt to some extent and may need surgery in the off-season

- AD still has a bone spur / may need surgery in off-season 

- D lo is hurt somewhat mysteriously and while it looks like he will be back who knows what he is dealing with

- mo Bamba injury means we don't have depth at big


We have a tough stretch - I believe we will make play-in but two games there will be tough. But then lets just say we get to 7 or 8 and play Denver or Phoenix. All it takes is one tweak or shitty thing for us to be fighting an uphill battle against two very good teams. 

I know all this shit is probably obvious but I remember in 2021 I really believed we could overcome the injuries in the playoffs and now I know better. The reality is our two best guys are too old and been through too much. D lo is good but we need a young all star who can carry the load, like a Shai type.",1.0
