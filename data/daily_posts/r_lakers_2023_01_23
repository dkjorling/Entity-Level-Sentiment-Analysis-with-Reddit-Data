But also trading for Rui was a very good move on paper.

Also, Rob had a good hand handing out veteran minimums this year (Dennis, TB).

Bev has not performed well at the beginning but has shown his value as a locker room presence and a good defender. He also seems to get better when it comes to shooting the bball.

Rob had very little to work with this off season and he seems to trun things around now. Let's cheer for him and acknowledge his contribution. Way to go Lakers Nation but things look better today than they did yesterday and Rob had a hand in this.",1.0

14,2023-01-24 02:51:35,10jv9d5,Updated practical max cap-space chart for next season after Rui Hachimura trade,BrianC_,"After the Rui Hachimura trade went down, I saw some incorrect numbers thrown around regarding the Laker's cap-space for next season and I figured I would just post an updated chart.

Player Name | Cap amount
:-- | :-- 
LeBron James | $46.9m
Anthony Davis | $40.6m
Rui Hachimura | $18.8m (cap-hold), $8.5m qualifying offer
Austin Reaves | $2.1m (cap-hold)
Wenyen Gabriel | $1.9m (cap-hold)
Max Christie | $1.7m
FRP cap-hold | ~$2.3m
Incomplete roster cap-hold | $1.1m
Incomplete roster cap-hold | $1.1m
Incomplete roster cap-hold | $1.1m
Incomplete roster cap-hold | $1.1m
Incomplete roster cap-hold | $1.1m
*Total payroll* | *$119.8m*
*Projected cap* | *$134m*
*Remaining cap-space* | *$14.2m*

This is not the team's max cap-space.  In theory, they could still waive all their cap-holds and push it up to around ~$36m.  But, that's obviously not very practical.

For this chart, the team would keep the cap-holds for Reaves and Wenyen to retain their early-bird-rights and would keep the cap-hold for Hachimura to retain his full-bird-rights.  They would keep their 2023 FRP and thus still have its cap-hold on the books (projected 20ish pick).  LeBron, AD, and Christie are still under contract for next season.  Damian Jones would be dumped in a deal if he opts into his player-option.  Everyone else would be left to expire.

I personally don't think Rui Hachimura will get an annual salary of $18.8m so his cap-hold really has no inherent value and the team would be better off negotiating an extension at a lesser value before the off-season.  If they can reach an agreement on an extension less than $18.8m, the Lakers would have more cap-space than projected above in the chart by however much less his extension is (for example, if Hachimura agrees to $13m annually, the Lakers would have an additional $5.8m in cap-space).",1.0

He’s a good player, don’t get me wrong. Good defender and a solid shooter. However, he’s in the last year of his contract so trading picks for him to leave the next year wouldn’t exactly be great. 

Disregarding that and looking simply at what he provides for this team, I don’t think he’s a *great* fit. A lot of our problems rn would be solved with AD coming back. As well as this, with TB playing so well, it wouldn’t make sense to add a *third* center. It would make either TB or Turner quite redundant at times. When it’s time to close games, we all know AD will be at the 5 and I’d therefore prefer we trade for a closer. 

With that being said, I don’t *hate* the idea, but I simply don’t understand the obsession with this guy. As well as this, he comes with Hield who has a terrible contract for multiple years. Though he is a good shooter, he’s terrible on defense (to say the least) and also isn’t closing games. Seriously, help me understand the obsession with this guy",1.0

I've spent the last few days in pure disbelief and it just doesn't make sense to me. I've spent the regular season since that start watching the Lakers play great basketball it's just not fair

If the Lakers lose to them again I will face that they deserved the wins, but I am just 100% sure it was a fluke and does a big disservice to the Lakers and the NBA.",1.0

103,2023-01-23 15:09:55,10jeoah,We all want to see a trade (that improves us) but who are the expendables on the team?,Kanajeji,"Everyone is hoping to see a trade but who are the role players that you genuinely believe are surplus to requirements here? Meaning players we can get better for value by trading them for someone else? There are six players that have been mentioned most in potential trades and here’s how I feel about them:

Damian Jones: This one goes without saying. I’m sure even he wants to get traded at this point. The man has banana peels for hands and doesn’t offer much else.

JTA: He’s not particularly bad and he’s not particularly good. He’s a minimum player and his skillset reflects as much. While I love his hustle I won’t mind losing him in a deal to bring back a better wing. Won’t mind him staying either.

Kendrick Nunn: Starting to find his groove but we have a log jam of guards on the team who do everything he does but better. One of the bigger salaries amongst role players too. A change of scenery is best for both parties.

Lonnie Walker: This is a little controversial because he’s been so good especially at the start of the season. But he’s regressed and his skillset is redundant with Schroeder and Reaves. His salary also makes him a good trading chip. I am intrigued by the prospect of a Lonnie/Schroeder backcourt though.

Pat Bev: He is an easy target because of his contract and how badly he started the season but he’s gotten his shot back, plays good defense and has intangibles like we saw yesterday that can amount to winning especially in a playoff environment. I don’t know how I feel about trading him.

Russ: The elephant in the room. I’m going to be honest, I never wanted him here. I thought he was a bad fit on the team since the trade was announced and unfortunately I, like many others was proven right about my trepidations about him. Trading him is also what’s best to get more out of our cap situation. But let’s be realistic here, is there really a trade for him that makes us exponentially better? You can talk about the Myles + Buddy trade but with how the Pacers have been competing I doubt that deal is still on the table. Trading for them also means we have virtually nothing left to re-sign our best playing role players this year, assuming we extend Myles.

Untouchables: Bron AD Reaves Christie.

Too hard to trade: Schroeder, Bryant, Wenyen, TBJ.

Tough decisions for our front office to make. Personally, I don’t think a massive trade is required for us to compete in this current NBA. The best-case scenario is to get a wing who can shoot or a wing with a reliable 3-pointer and a sharpshooter. Heck, maybe just get both Cam Reddish and Rui Hachimura or one of those two and a sharpshooter like Doug McDermott. The first four guys I mentioned plus a second-round pick or two can get that done. I like a lineup of Dennis, TBJ/LWIV/Bev (If one of them stays), LBJ, AD, and Bryant. Depending on the matchup, you can switch either TBJ or Bryant with whichever wing we get or a sharpshooter and move AD to the 5. 

Indeed, most of our success is going to be predicated on AD and LeBron’s health. With how those two have been playing and the parity in the league, anything is possible with a tweak or two. Do you guys have any realistic ideas for beneficial trades that aren’t just for the sake of making a trade like a lot of the awful ones floating on this sub?",1.0

But if we do trade for him, don’t we get his bird rights? So with the cap that we get from Westbrook’s expiring, wouldn’t we be able to use up most of our cap space on 2 good free agents (jerami grant/kuzma and Josh Richardson/Alex burks) and maybe Reaves + TB, and then sign Trent afterwards? We would then roll out something like Burks/Trent/Lebron/Kuz/AD with a bench of Schroder/Reaves/Christie/TB",1.0
