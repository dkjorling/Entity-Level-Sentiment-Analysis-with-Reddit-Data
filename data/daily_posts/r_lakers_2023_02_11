2,2023-02-12 07:13:07,1109q8d,Is Rui Hachimura a better fit with the Lakers today than Kuzma was back then?,alphonseelric2,"I don't know about much of the stats, and I'm pretty sure Kuzma has always been the better player than Rui. But anyone here who thinks Rui has been a better fit with the team than Kuzma back then?

Offensively, he doesn't go off for 30-40 like Kuzma, but he also doesn't outshoot the team and looks very steady with his offense even with less touches and even if you surround him with multiple scorers/ball-handlers.

He also doesn't make mistakes often and has done a great job bailing out the team when the offense gets stagnant. It's like when he gets the ball, you know it's an automatic bucket or simply just a non-stupid play.

Rui's size is always felt as well. His rebounding has kept a lot of plays alive and his defense has been a positive for the team.

Do you think Rui is a better fit? Is it because Rui is more comfortable off the ball? Or maybe it has something to do with expectation since Kuzma was expected to be a third star? What are your thoughts?",1.0

Like am I missing something or is this current team just as good as the 2020 team that won the chip? You guys have your two super stars in Lebron and AD. Dlo is a borderline all star player and now you’ve surrounded those 3 with quite a bit of depth and shooting. Am I missing something or should the lakers be given a little more respect in the still in my opinion pretty wide open west. You give a Lebron led team a shot against any non KD GSW team and I think they have a shot to win the series.,1.0

12 guys who deserve rotational minutes, and Max Christie also a playable dude. Not possible to play this many guys. Out of the bottom 5, I think Beasley needs to get regular minutes because of the shooting ability, probably Bamba as well if he plays with some motor.

Playing fast isn't a bad thing, but the way Russ does it, he makes so many mistakes out of it. 

Dlo plays slow and under control, not making too many unnecessary turnover passes, makes his jumpers and can actually finish layups respectably. Almost everything is an opposite of Russ.",1.0

54,2023-02-11 20:02:44,10zwhvi,Dialogue from a D’Angelo Russell stan.,ActGucci,"I’ve been following DLo as a player since he was in High School and he is consistently underrated. He led the Wolves to making the playoffs bc of his leadership and veteran ability. He is 26 year old leader and extremely vocal on defense even if he isn’t the best defender. His shooting has been the best it’s been since his all star yeat, nearly shooting 50/40/90 in 2023 so far. DLo consistently went on stretches either in the 1st Q or 4th, (known for being clutch) of 14 points straight. Playing behind Kat and Ant was difficult since they are both ball dominant. Gobert couldn’t catch a pass w his brick hands. LeBron and AD will have life so much easier having DLo on the court. Vando and Beasley had great chemistry with Lo on the Wolves, which will easily transfer over to the Lakers. As long as they can be consistent on defense the offense will be as consistent as ever this season. Got a great feeling for you guys this will end in great growth for the playoffs and next years Laker team having this built already. ❄️💜💛",1.0
