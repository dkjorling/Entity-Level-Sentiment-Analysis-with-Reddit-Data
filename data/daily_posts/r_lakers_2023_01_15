3,2023-01-16 05:52:44,10d6kyh,Hindsight is 20:20 but Ham made the right call not taking a timeout. Russ was absolutely hacked and had no use of an entire arm. Refs are the reason to blame for losing 2 straight games.,BBaron08,"Seriously guys. If Ham took a timeout, we‚Äôd j bound the ball to LeBron, watch him dribble for 12 seconds and either kick it out to someone with 2 seconds left to put up a rushed shot or do some low probability fadeaway.

The 76ers also would have had a chance to set their defense and be ready.

It was a bang/bang play and he took the gamble.

It‚Äôs not his fault Embiid just literally grabbed the dudes wrist and completely eliminating one hand of his so Russ is forced to drive the ball and throw up some prayer because he has no use of one entire arm.",1.0

15,2023-01-16 05:25:48,10d63a5,LeBron is Leaving. Here‚Äôs why,Cool_Date_3832,"LeBron is definitely leaving the Lakers and here is why.

Recently, a rumor came out that LeBron will request a trade at the end of the season. He did not bother to confirm it nor deny it. This has been the case for any LeBron career rumor for the entirety of his career. When rumors came out at the star of the 09-10 season that LeBron might go for Chicago or Miami, no word from the King. Same can be said when rumors buzzed in the middle of the 13-14 season when the Heat were losing a step. This was also true at the end of the 16-17 season when rumors started that he might go to LA. Now, with that said. Expect a major rebuild in the off-season, my friends. AD will probably request a trade to Chicago. Bron is probably going to Cleveland or Phoenix. I just hope we get some good assets back. It was a good run. They got a chip for Kobe and I think that alone is something we should be thankful to Bron and AD for.

Our average to above average role players are injured, our best player is 38 yet single handedly keeping us in games without any support and his teammates can‚Äôt make a three if their life depended on it, we‚Äôve got a great player who is injured more than he plays but is played out of position cause hey FO genius shit, we‚Äôve got the most expensive 6th man in the history of the NBA who cannot fucking shoot the ball and makes more boneheaded plays than not, our coach is a rookie who makes moronic mistakes as if we needed to make it harder on ourselves, our FO is probably the legit worst in the league with their absolute incompetence in making roster decisions or making any trades to help the team and there is nothing to show it gets better anytime soon. 

We‚Äôve had a terrible last couple of years Laker fans, but hey atleast we got each other to get us through this shit-show. All I do now is appreciate LeBron and hope something falls our way in the seasons after him cause I sure as hell ain‚Äôt quitting on our team. Laker for life man.",1.0
20,2023-01-16 05:18:35,10d5ygo,Why are lakers fans so quick to blame russ?,anothermanstrash1,"Yes he made a horrible decision by dribbling out the clock and taking a tough shot but Darwin Ham should be held completely responsible for not calling a timeout. I find it weird how quick fans are to quick to jump on the russ hate bandwagon as soon as he messes up in a game where he played exceptionally well. It's funny because if lebron did this everyone would be defending him and saying ""he just messed up  on the final possession and carried us all game"" Which literally happened yesterday when fans were quick to defend him after his poor performance. Also it's not russ fault that he couldnt find lebron whens he literally no where to be seen in those final seconds. I'm seriously starting to think that this sub has more lebron stans than lakers fans and THIS IS COMING FROM A LAKERS FAN NOT RUSS. Also I love bron just had to get that out. All I'm saying is that yall need to relax lol we have like 4 of our main players injured and Schroder has been playing atrociously the last few games (something I dont see people mentioning surprisingly and is definitely effecting us in this losing streak).

Wenyen is good at defense but not an enforcer on offense. He fumbled one of Lebron's passes at the end.

Yes Westbrook missed his shot, but that Wenyen play was big. Also when LeBron had to chuck up a bad shot.

Coach should've done some offense and defense subs. That's all I'm saying.

He hasn't done it all season with his timeouts. He needs to.

Thomas Bryant should've been in on the last possession.",0.5
