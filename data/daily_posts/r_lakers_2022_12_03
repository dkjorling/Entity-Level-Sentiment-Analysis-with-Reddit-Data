5,2022-12-04 04:23:48,zc0af9,"We‚Äôre playing well, but what‚Äôs missing? What‚Äôs next for us?",Smoovekriminal1999,"We really aren‚Äôt a bad basketball team. Things are finally starting to click for us, and our two big dogs are healthy and looking great. Not to mention Russ looks really good off the bench as well, the whole team just looks really fluid with the exception of a few players. While I do think we‚Äôre a piece or two away, I think the front office has to move very methodically. 

At the moment, I do not think we should trade Russ. He‚Äôs playing well, and that would really ruin the chemistry we‚Äôve built thus far. Unless the front office thinks we have a LEGITIMATE chance to contend if we trade Russ I don‚Äôt think they should. This is his last year on the books then we will have the flexibility to sign solid players in free agency in the summer, and keep one or BOTH of our first‚Äôs. 

I would much rather prefer a trade package of Nunn, Bev, maybe one first, and a couple seconds for a solid backup big man to play behind AD. I know we need wings but I like a couple free agents, those being Josh Jackson who is 6‚Äô8 and Mo Hark who‚Äôs 6‚Äô9. 

Let me know what y‚Äôall think.",0.85

Coach Ham realized that 38 years old Lebron postup for late game stretch isn't working, and he also created a rotation that Lebron Russ and AD getting good amount of rest and playing time. Crucial especially when we think lebron was able to defend and score in crucial moment and AD with less foul troubles.

It was also remarkable how turnovers has decreased immensely, especially from Russ and Lebron. Russ played like a 'pointguard'. Just high quality pnr passes, kickouts and assists to AD. We only had 4(!!) turnovers for entire game against the league's number 1 defensive team. 

This is just a excellent start for 6 game road trip, especially when we beat the team who played excellent for their standard also and their full squad.",1.0

I don‚Äôt think Dennis or Nunn can replicate that and LeBron can‚Äôt carry the ball handling duties the whole game like 2020. He‚Äôs actually a vital part of the Lakers roster right now. Any trade that ships him off needs to guarantee either an elite offense or defense. I like Turner and Hield but I think AD‚Äôs numbers would start to decline without Westbrook feeding him.

Russ, 1 Laker first(unprotected) for Rozier, PJ, Oubre. Get two expiring 6‚Äô7, 6‚Äô8 wings that have a capable shot as well as a young ball handler in Rozier to replace Russ.

Pat Bev, Kendrick Nunn, 1 laker first(protected) for Myles Turner. A former DPOY candidate playing well this season that‚Äôll take pressure off AD and form the best paint defense in the league.

With these moves the team has acquired a younger ball handler that can shoot better, two 6‚Äô7 wings, and a floor spacing big.",1.0
28,2022-12-03 18:09:33,zbmh2b,2 for 1,wilsynet,"Let's say there are 48 seconds left in the quarter, and you have the ball. 2 for 1 makes sense if you're ***behind*** by 4-6 points (ie. more than one possession). In this scenario, if you take most of your 24 seconds to score, and the other team takes most of their 24 seconds to score, then you aren't going to have much time to score again. You better try to score early, so that you have another possession to try to score again. 2 for 1 makes sense here.

But if, on the other hand, let's say you are ***ahead*** by 2 points, then using 10 seconds to get up a shitty shot, followed by the other team using their 24 seconds, so that you get another 10 seconds to get up another shitty shot. That doesn't make sense unless your name is Steph or Dame and the shot is routine. Otherwise, why would I trade one good possession for two shitty possessions if I am not forced to do so?",1.0

39,2022-12-03 12:14:32,zbexub,Time to overreact: The Lakers are a trade away from being contenders,tall_mf_,"As the title says, I believe the Lakers could legitimately be a trade away from being a contender. With a 2-10 start, the Lakers have gone 7-2 since, with the only losses being to the Suns (best team in the west) and the Pacers. 

The Pacers game sucks as we were one shot from a 2k generated player away from being 8-1, but the loss to the Suns is totally acceptable. 

With that being said, the Lakers are playing great, shooting well from the field and even the 3 (37%) in that stretch. We are 6th in Net rating, 9th in offense and 5th in defense! AD is dominating and Lebron seems to be back and playing great as well. 

Our role players are playing good too as Lonnie is having a career year, hitting crazy dunks, splashing threes and actually playing good defense. Reaves is shooting fucking 50/40/90, Schroder and TB have been good since coming back, Westbrook has been better off the bench. 

With all that being said, I think the time is now for the Lakers to pull off a trade and ship Westbrook out of here. With a good trade, I actually believe the Lakers could contend with some of the best teams in the league and even make push for a top 5 seed",0.77
