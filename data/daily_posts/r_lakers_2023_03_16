Below is a list of the top 10 players within that period with the most playoff games played who wore purple and gold (excluding picks that have been traded to other teams).

Top 10 playoff games played:

1) Patrick Beverley (65)

2) Jordan Clarkson (43)

3) Ivica Zubac (34)

4) Kyle Kuzma (27)

5) Larry Nance Jr. (26)

6) D'Angelo Russell (11)

7) Darius Morris (9)

8) Andrew Goudelock (9)

9) Brandon Ingram (6)

Can the Lakers make a deep run going against Denver or the Kings in the 1st round?,GetLeBronHelpLakers,It's getting tougher and tougher to get a top 6 spot when the Lakers are barely holding on to a Play-in spot. Most likely we will end up as a play-in seed so that means we're either going against Denver in the 1st seed or Kings in the 2nd seed. Do you think the Lakers have a chance against these 2?,1.0

22,2023-03-16 13:14:49,11stufb,Unnecessary Pelinka hype,kropotkin_mutual_aid,"Last year guy destroyed beautiful team by giving too much for westbrook. It's not important what davis or bron wanted we gave up too much for not efficient point guard and it costed us a season. Now this summer we lost last year's second best player and obviously great chemistry by letting malik monk to go. We had a big problems beyond westbrook bad fit. Lonnie walker, kendrick Nunn, Dennis Schroeder,westbrook,Austin reaves,Patrick Beverly all of them are undersized and very one dimensional players outside of reaves which developed through all season. Building this garbage team and insisting on it now costing us second season in a raw. Now everyone hyped this guy for pulling great trade but who we get?? Malik beasley is not outstanding player Malik monk,KCP was in the same level maybe even better, Vanderbilt is great energy guy but we had kuzma, montrez harrel which we gave up for westbrook. Dlo is great fit but we know that all his career he had up and downs and I don't think he will stay on this level. Sending Thomas bryant was awful decision he was one of the best center substitute. I mean we probably gonna miss play offs even in best scenario we gonna face with Denver or Memphis in first round and gonna get destroyed definitely.I mean missing play offs 2 season in a raw that team has lebron and davis is really hard.Pelinka is worst GM in the league and it's not gonna change.",1.0
23,2023-03-16 13:11:10,11stra4,Do you expect AD to last another 5 years?,ImprovementSilly2895,"Since signing his new contract (190M) in 2020-21 he has played in about 50% of possible games. Heâ€™s age 30 now and historically, playersâ€™ bodies start getting more wear and tear injuries as they age. And of course, we know AD is constantly plagued with injuries. 

At the end of his current contract, he could realistically be just a shell of the player he is now. Do you expect him to play and perform at a high level at age 35? The probability seems low unless he gets lucky.",1.0
