4,2023-02-20 23:41:16,117odmh,Not that it’s relevant but since there’s no basketball I thought I’d share my favorite non-basketball Kobe memory. His reaction to the Eagles winning the Super Bowl was so wholesome and relatable it was great seeing him so excited.,xThe-Legend-Killerx,"I always thought it was such a cool thing to see someone like him who won multiple titles with the Lakers sitting their like a little kid as he realized the Eagles were going to win the Super Bowl.

As someone who is a fan of a team that hasn’t won one yet I could totally picture myself having a similar reaction. So it was nice to see him just like one of us regular joes. 

What’s your guys’ favorite non-basketball Kobe memory?",1.0

9,2023-02-20 21:55:49,117lsbp,Who is someone the Lakers should use their last roster spot for?,CCPalmeri5,"With a lot of the top buyout candidates, like Love, Green, and Ross, being taken off the board, I’ve had a hard time thinking of who the Lakers should use their final roster spot on.

I’ve thought of few avenues the Lakers could go down.

1. Bring a guy up from G-League or give the spot to one of their Two-way guys.
- Huff
- Pippen Jr.
- Swider

2. Take a flyer on a young player.
- Jarrett Culver
- David Nwaba
- Josh Jackson
- Moses Brown

3. Bring in a vet.
- Boogie
- Melo
- Bazemore (LOL)
- Aldridge 
- Jeremy Lamb
- Rodney Hood

These names are obviously not jaw droppers, but they are just some names of a few current free agents that stood out to me. Ideally they sign a wing, but I’m curious to see what guys y’all are interested in.",1.0
