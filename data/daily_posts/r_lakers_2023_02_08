Yes, ideally a 3&amp;D or a another big would help but our roster stands as follows:

PG: DLo
SG: Reaves
SF: Rui

26,2023-02-09 05:52:24,10xmxo0,From a Wolves perspective: Here's what you are getting in D'Lo/Vando/Beasley,mr_purrfect,"Hello Lakers reddit, I come in peace. I've watched every Wolves game over the past 3 seasons (since Edwards was drafted) and thought you might want a little bit of information about your new guys. After all, you now have 4/7 of the best players on the Wolves from last year! That team had great chemistry and I think this will help minimize some of the growing pains which can come with trades.

Now, onto the players...

- **D'Angelo Russell**: A guy the Lakers are certainly familiar with, he's leaving the Wolves at maybe his highest point with the team. His shooting has been insane lately and he has been a major part of the team winning without KAT. With this said, it feels like a good chunk of the fan base is happy to see him gone. His basketball IQ is high but his effort on the court goes through major lapses that can last weeks or even months. This clip - https://streamable.com/jdsw3d - is a perfect example and stuff like this has happened more times than I can remember. Also, get used to the transition pull up 3 with no offensive rebounders under the basket. He's also a huge negative rebounding the ball despite his big size and wing span for a guard.

- **Jarred Vanderbilt**: Low effort... that's a phase that doesn't exist in Vando's vocabulary. The guy has Rodman like traits and is an insane rebounder. Add in that he is a great perimeter defender for his size and he's one of the more underrated players in the NBA. His biggest weakness with the Wolves was shooting, but his time in Utah has helped to expand his offensive game outside of the paint from non-existent to below average. He's a fun player to have on your team and to cheer for.

- **Malik Beasley**: This guy has one NBA skill... shoot 3s and shoot a lot of them. His dribble drive game improved somewhat in Utah but it's still below average. He is a unique player and his frequent comparison when he played for the Wolves was Duncan Robinson. I would say he's a better defender than Duncan but has a much lower IQ on the court. He will shoot you into games and also shoot you out of them. He was a somewhat frustrating player to cheer for because when his shots aren't falling you want him to take a seat... but that doesn't always happen.

Hope you guys found these insightful and good luck the rest of the season! I think you will really like Vando in particular, we miss him with the Wolves and he is on a great contract.",1.0

33,2023-02-09 05:10:54,10xm5wi,This might be the most offensively talented roster Lebron has ever played with,Academic-Principle14,"The best roster Lebron ever had was the ‘12-‘13 Heat with Wade, Bosh, Chalmers, Allen, Haslem, Birdman, Battier, Cole, and  Miller

Let’s compare.

Healthy AD &gt; 2013 Wade

Bosh was a better player than Rui is right now but it’s not a stretch to say that Rui can match Bosh’s actual production from that season (he only averaged 12 PPG in the playoffs and played solid D) 

DLO &gt; Mario Chalmers

Schroeder/Beverly &gt; Norris Cole

Ray Allen &gt; Malik Beasley

Vanderbilt is better on D than Haslem but Haslem is the better offensive player

Birdman was better than TB on D but I’ll take TB on offense

And the remaining guys are Lonnie Walker, Austin Reaves, Troy Brown, and Shane Battier


The main reason being that Bron and Wade’s play styles weren’t really complimentary to one another. Bron/AD/DLo is literally a perfect combination. 

The ‘13 Heat had more shooters, but I think the new Lakers are better at the top. This team has 4 guys who can legitimately create high % shots for themselves (Lebron/AD/DLO/Rui)

If this kid was a better shooter, HE WOULDN'T have ever been traded even once in his career. He's still young though, so there is still potential there to develop into a elite 3&amp;D player, but if he doesn't, who the hell cares. Pairing AD and Vandy is damn near cheating on both defense and the glass. I'd give up both picks UNPROTECTED to pull this deal off, that's how much I LOVE his defense and the effort which he plays with.

Why would I not record a literal huge moment is sports history? I would want to be able to relive the moment where I was personally at many times.

If russ expires, your return is the 20m of cap for ALL the above invested, not to mention 2 disaster seasons. That’s blatantly basketball malpractice if that happens and I hope the FO realizes that

The season is probably cooked but not moving Russ literally cooks next year too

Taking on longer term money is the key. In the perfect world, you invest 1 FRP w Russ to get long term money on the books. Then this summer you have 2 FRPs to trade w those longer term salaries to make a big move. In addition, you would operate as an over the cap team and have access to the MLE (someone can correct me if it’s the TPMLE instead)

The Los Angeles Lakers are a badly coached team. 

The defense is atrocious. Giving up 70+ points in the first half to Pelicans and Thunder is inexcusable. They both made 10+ threes in these halves. 

I blame coaching for this. Defensive schemes are just terrible if every team in the league shoots like prime Warriors against this team. 

It’s not a Russell Westbrook issue. Darwin Ham is not competent enough to coach an NBA team and it’s becoming more obvious every game. 

No matter who they trade for, Ham will prevent the team from contending. 

He is a terrible defensive coach, he doesn’t run any plays, there is no movement on offense, he doesn’t know when to call a timeout or how to adjust in late game situations. 

Any success of this Lakers team is purely a result of phenomenal play from LeBron and Davis this season. 

Based on LeBron’s and Davis’ attitude last game and in interviews we can make an assumption that some decision has been made regarding the future of this team. 

Maybe Anthony Davis received the news that he will require a surgery.

Maybe the Lakers are in talks to trade Anthony Davis before the deadline.

Ham subbed him out at 58 seconds left in the 3rd when Bron needed 1 bucket for the record and i'm pretty he was just bummed to not be on the court or maybe get the assist, etc... Look at his November and December game logs before he got hurt and even the last 3 games he played once he was off the minutes restriction... He has been balling.

I get then sense he too is fed up with this coaching staff and maybe even russ after his comments tonight and the ones earlier in the year about the ""my bads""

The problem for the this team is the front office has fumbled every decision they've made since the start of the '20-'21 season... That offseason was actually pretty good, sure every move didnt work out perfect but the biggest problem on the title team was bench scoring when Bron/AD were resting so they tinkered and picked up the top 2 finishers in 6MOTY voting in Trez and DS and went for stretch big Gasol and lets face it they were criticized for letting brooke lopez go with ppl saying ""he'd have been perfect with LBJ &amp; AD"" so it made some sense and if you look at the stats, Gasol's minutes were a big positive esp knowing they planned to use AD at the 5 esp in crunch ch time. 

For me the beginning of the end was the trade deadline... they did all this shopping and alienated the roster (that made sense with the young bois tryna get AD or Kawhi but less with a team that was trying to win a title) before ultimately doing nothing, treating THT like the second coming of jordan and getting drummond in a buyout and stupidly promising he would start. All of that fucked with the locker room chemistry.

Now that team was beat from winning the title and the weird quick turn around to the season after the bubble but even with all that they were in good shape up 2-1 on the suns with AD dropping 34 in the 2 wins before he got hurt. So lost season... but we all knew it was going to be tough to turn around after that finals run and abbreviated offseason. But this was a good team that had some tough injuries but a few small movies might have made them contenders again in '21-'22... KCP, Caruso and Gasol all shot over 40% from three on over 9 combined attempts and Bron and Kuz each over 36% on a combines almost 12 attempts.  As a team they outshot their opponents from three percentage wise on the season .354 to .352.

Then here comes the nightmare... they WAYYY overreacted and thought hey let's trade all the pieces that are proven to fit with Bron &amp; AD plus a 1st round pick for russ... they guy we LITERALLY DIDN'T GUARD in the playoffs in 2020 and then surround them with the all geriatric/washed team... I mean Deandre Jordan was the starting center!? DJ Augustin, Isaiah Thomas, bring back Rondo who shot 36.6 percent... FROM 2!? I mean it says something when by the end of the season that rookie austin reeves and glorified g leaguer stanley johnson were 2 of the best role players on the team.  on top of that you let caruso go for nothing and kept THT when it would have cost 7 million to keep the goat 🤦🏾‍♂️. And intentionally or not russ basically sabotaged the season cuz he didnt like Vogel!? Stories of Rambis interfering in coaching decisions, etc... and then you fire the coach who had won you the title and replace him with an unproven rookie coach? and don't hire and experienced assistant!? 

And honestly most of the former player coaches I see that get the respect of their players were either high bbIQ stars (like J Kidd or larry bird) or at least starters (doc rivers) in the league or role players that contributed to great teams or championship teams (like brian shaw or ty lue)... ham was a straight up end of the bench guy who only once averaged more than 5 points in a season (5.1) I just dont think he is head coach material and the way his team is playing seems to prove that... They've given up 264 points in their last 2 games to teams that have been playing very poorly and when you watch them the players don't seem to have any idea what they are trying to accomplish on either end... tonight's loss was after a practice where they'd reportedly installed some things lol. The rotations are absolute trash, dont get me started on the 3 guards.  I mean just recently lebron was on the bench going into the 1/2... what was he resting for? Strenuous 1/2 time film session? And to not use their timeouts in the last couple possessions tonight is just so JV i don't even know what to say.  The thing to me that proves how poorly they are coached is they get behind and the game is essentially over and the players just press and play aggressive trapping defense which is outside of the normal defensive scheme and they make these almost comebacks basically everytime which just proves the normal scheme is shit.  Their three point defense is ""leave them other team wide open and hope they miss"".  On offense you can see other than AD and Bron there is no confidence or consistent aggressive play... players look like they are just hoping their shots go in🤞🏾🤞🏾... there's no offense run to get guys to their preferred spots.  When Phil Jackson was coaching even guys like shannon brown, josh powell and dj mbenga would come in and play with confidence, know their roles and look completely familiar with the system.

Until today i really thought a trade could turn this team into a contender but with these inept coaches I just don't see any way that happens... i hope they prove me wrong and i HOPE TO GOD russ is gone by they end of the week.  Unless this team makes a run in the playoffs ham has GOT TO GO! (maybe even more than russ... but prolly not lol).

Anyway i just really needed to vent... After watching and loving this team for close to 40 years other than finals losses to boston and detroit this is the most upset ive been after a Lakers game.

Hoping for better times ahead and Go Lakers!",1.0
283,2023-02-08 09:38:29,10wsiz7,Random but did anyone else expect the whole team to hype LeBron up after breaking the record?,JRQC428,"I’ve put out my thoughts of this team lacking something on &amp; off court. Aside from poor coaching, line ups &amp; losing games we should’ve won but didn’t. None the less I did see great teammates stand &amp; clap for Lebron, except AD.. who god knows what going on there. The celebration from teammates felt quiet. Idk maybe I thought they were all gonna go jump up &amp; down together or something. Before all the trading talks &amp; how this season has played out, I’ve always had this awkward vibe from this team. Russ is more &amp; more proving to not be a great fit with what we have. Russ &amp; Lebron lack interactions &amp; some heaviness just shows through Russ. Idk what AD was in his feels about but if anyone was gonna go crazy for Lebron breaking the record I imagined AD by his side.
Sorry to be the pessimistic one but realistically, this team with what I think lacks other than “chemistry” on court… idk good luck making the playoffs.",1.0

- Leaves right after game starts, comes out right before he checks back in. Doesn't interact with anyone including LeBron

- When Lebron broke the scoring record, he stayed away from him. LeBron went over to the team later and Westbrook was standing at midcourt.

Also discussed Davis says he seemed like a zombie

290,2023-02-08 08:26:10,10wrfq1,We have to finally concede this season,less-ismore,"Tonight was a microcosm of our season. AD even IF there’s not something seriously wrong looked like he didn’t even belong on the court tonight. Bron was enjoying the moment but how can we really envision them making any type of run after a performance on such an important night given the record, and the standings against a team that’s directly in front of us? 

I’ve been trying to defend Ham the entire season, say Russ has been better this year, if AD comes back healthy, etc. but who are we kidding? We’re a dumpster fire. The sooner they realize this for a fact the sooner we can turn the corner and pivot towards a legitimate rebuild. 

Is LeBron going to stay? Will AD be traded eventually?",1.0
