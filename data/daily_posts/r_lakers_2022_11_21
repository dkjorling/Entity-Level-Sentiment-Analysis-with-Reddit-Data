7,2022-11-22 00:48:31,z1fp7a,Are These Recent LeBron/Lakers Offense Takes Tongue-in-Cheek or Do People truly believe this stuff?,ChasingItLikeDWest,"
I thought these ‚ÄúLeBron is the problem‚Äù takes were just jokes. Then I started seeing some ‚ÄúLeBron needs to change his game‚Äù takes. What exactly do people want him to change? Do people even watch basketball? Is it that people just don‚Äôt understand what they are watching? Some people truly believe LeBron still consistently uses up possessions/shot clock at Luka levels.

[These are all of the Lakers possessions in the 1ST and 4TH quarters of the Clippers game (the last game he played), with LeBron on the floor.](https://streamable.com/4xky77)


Watching these possessions, what exactly was LeBron doing that would prevent AD from being AD? There are simple explanations for why AD and the Lakers have looked good lately:

1. No LeBron, more possessions for AD.
2. AD has been more aggressive.
3. Lakers had four days without a game and used that time to watch film, practice and clean up some stuff. You can see their DHOs have improved (not great but better). Nothing more annoying than when teams run DHOs and the guy getting the hand-off stops and allows his defender to get back in front of him. You just defeated the whole purpose of a DHO and took some time off your shot clock, making the offense look even more stagnant.
4. The competition they‚Äôve faced.

Yes, LeBron is going to use up some clock in these situations: 

1. On post ups.
2. When he gets a switch on a big guy, he‚Äôll take his sweet time and go for a step back three or a drive. https://streamable.com/gq0ft2
3. When he gets switched onto a little guy, he‚Äôll take his time and back him down.

In all three of the above situations, if he misses the shot or turns the ball over, it looks really bad (as a lot of time comes off the shot clock, oftentimes with teammates standing around watching). Somebody like MITWestBrook would clip that and use it as ‚Äúevidence‚Äù for why LeBron slows down the offense. I remember reading one of the comments on one of his posts and someone said something in the vein of ‚Äúhow is he wrong if he is providing video proof?‚Äù You can clip videos and pick stats to tell whatever story you wanna tell, especially with a small sample size. You gotta at least watch whole quarters or stretches, to critique someone's playstyle. Anyone who has been watching the Lakers can tell LeBron has been offball plenty and has been getting rid of the ball quickly. I actually would like him to run more pick n rolls. I don‚Äôt like when he just stands in the perimeter and throw passes, which he‚Äôs been doing a lot.

In sum, he is not slowing down the offense. He has just been awful. His FG, FT and 3PT averages are currently below his career average. Yes, in certain situations like the ones I outlined above (and important stretches, like end of quarter, to stop a run or to close a game), he is going to hold the ball. Making the right decisions in those situations is one of the things he does best. Again, he has just been awful so far. Acting like he just routinely stops the flow of this offense just does not jive with the film. There are legit criticisms for LeBron, there‚Äôs no need to just make shit up. LeBron cuts, often when he is in the corner. If he cuts and doesn‚Äôt get the ball, he will put his head down. If he seals his man in the paint and doesn‚Äôt get the ball https://streamable.com/s0qhwf, he‚Äôll put his head down and might take time getting back on defense.",0.87

The comments on that post were almost entirely people blasting me for criticizing it, eventually the post got removed. That means a mod saw the post, which 100% complied with the sub‚Äôs rules, and deleted it for an alternate reason. This, in conjunction with the alarming number of people on this sub claiming to want Kyrie here, leads to a rather scary conclusion. Either a lot of this sub is composed of anti-semites, including at least one mod, or I just got a REALLY unlucky batch. I want to think it‚Äôs the second, but regardless this is not something that should be taken lightly.",1.0

25,2022-11-21 15:04:06,z115mx,We aren't better without LeBron but he also needs to change,Fulmizant,LeBron uses alot of offensive time and resources; and to be honest he kinda also contributes to our spacing issues in a nuanced way. We need him to dominate in transition and make quicker decisions. The ball has been moving around and the guards are attacking quickly and feeding AD or finishing; Bron needs to find a way to fit into that. The team is still better with him but he's simply taking too long to get where he needs to go. I think we can all agree with that,1.0

32,2022-11-21 08:45:40,z0txda,Anthony Davis‚Äôs stats this season vs 2019/2020,Bigbully_69,"
2019/2020 - 26/9/3/ and 2 blks on 50/33/84 splits

This season - 25/12/3 with 2 blks on 55/23/80 splits 

So as you can see, his stats look almost
identical except one glaring difference. He shot 33% from 3 on about 2.5 attemps a game, compared to only 23% on 1 attemp this season. 

The last couple seasons, both his free throw - and three point percentage had been on a steady decline, but sa far throughout his first 14 games, AD is hitting his free throws at a once again consistent rate. However, the same thing cannot be said for his 3pt shooting unfortunately. 

Now we can only hope that his three point shot will come around again, but AD has been playing really great in almost every other way. 

Aside from the mentioned free throw shooting, he‚Äôs actually shooting a career high 57% from 2. Not only is he dominating in the paint, but he‚Äôs actually been somewhat effective in the short midrange, knocking down a career high 54% of his shots from 3-10 feet. 

Aside from the shooting, he‚Äôs also been dominating on the boards, averaging 11.5 boards which is great considering he‚Äôs never even averaged over 10 since coming to LA. 

Lastly, I just wanna point out how many of AD‚Äôs buckets are ‚Äúself made‚Äù. Only 42% of AD‚Äôs buckets have been assisted this season which is really low for a big man. Looking at his career averages of 66%, we can clearly see that this is incredibly low. This is most likely largely due to Lebron missing some games, but it‚Äôs great to see AD just be able to iso or post up his defender to score without needing to be constantly set up for easy baskets. 

Obviously, we also cannot forget his defense as he‚Äôs once again absolutely dominating on that end as well. He‚Äôs blocking 2 shots a game for the first time since the 19/20 season will also being pretty disruptive with getting steals. Overall, AD is performing amazingly well on both offense and defense so far this season",1.0
