1,2022-10-15 06:14:53,y4gbfd,Blowout loss‚Ä¶,Positive_Narwhal_419,Damn near 50 point blowout loss and people still pointing the finger at Russ lol dude played a whole 4 mins yet he‚Äôs still gets all the blame wild lol this roster just isn‚Äôt as good as people think it‚Äôll be. Watching this game made me realize how much depth the kings had on their squad. Clearly what the lakers lack. None of the guards that played today for the lakers really made an impact. The bigs were just as disappointing. Pretty much bron running around and doing all the work lol this team needs a huge change,0.44

3,2022-10-15 05:58:07,y4g189,The Lakers Front Office has not aggressively targeted shooting for several years!!,PresidentClash,"Some will cite the 2020 championship but I think people underestimate how difficult winning is and the things that had to go right for the Lakers to win.

In 2020 the Lakers were an average 3-pt shooting team in the regular season. 


In the 2020 Playoffs: the reason our shooting went up is the % for our players did: AD 38%, Lebron 37%, Markief Morris 42%, Rondo 40%, KCP 37%


That season was a statistical outlier because half those guys had career years from 3 and players don‚Äôt just beat their career record every year


In 2021, The Lakers fell apart in the playoffs because they could not make a single 3.


2021- 2022 Szn we missed the playoffs, our shooting was a little better but our offensive lineups and defense were terrible. 


Can we honestly say that the front office has prioritized shooting? To me they just got lucky in 2020 and since then the shooting is terrible bc the personelll are not great 3-or shooters

The trajectory is the same this year unless guys like Lonnie Walker break out with a near  40% shooting year",0.72

8,2022-10-15 04:44:22,y4erc3,The Two Pillars of Lakers 2020 Championship Team Isn't The Reason Why Lakers Keep on Losing,Glad_Task_7169,"There's no question, LBJ and AD can still consistently provide the team the stat they've been producing in their entire career, they are fine folks, the problem is the rest of the Roster is just ass, these little people hired by Pelinka are just not winners at the end of the day, they are shaky, lacking in talent and simply not ready for prime time. If this losing keeps up and we carry this losing culture to the regular season, Coach Ham will get the Vogel treatment and Rob will get extended or promoted again. 

Ever since the Lakers recent championship, we can't seem to get our perfect starting five since the LBJ, AD, KCP, DG, Dwight/Mcgee dominating era. Vogel spent the entire season shuffling everything trying to recapture the dominance of the Lakers 2020 championship team to no avail, folks, it looks like we're heading in the same direction with Ham. Just like Vogel, looks like Ham is slowly being sucked by the egregious Roster construction and he is about to follow the footsteps of Vogel.

I don't know where Lebron and his little people can go from here. Maybe it's time to dial back further the expectations.",0.94

Anytime you see a lineup without LeBron on the court the team looks like a total disaster. I don't see any player on this team better, and players like Austin look even worse than last year!

Awful rebounding, awful 3 pt shooting, just as bad defense.. I don't see ANYTHING better than last year whatsoever.

And AD already on his injury journey, Russ now injured... did you see this game we had like 6 straight possession of just LeBron iso-ing just like last year?


No no no. This is not it. I see no hope.",0.68

35,2022-10-14 15:49:59,y3xjmo,When will LeBron pass Kareem?,BoCruz22,"Math time! If you woke up this morning and wanted to know how LeBron can/will break Kareem Abdul-Jabbar‚Äôs career scoring record, we got you covered. Right now, LeBron trails Kareem's record by 1,325 points. If LeBron plays¬†**all 82 games**¬†this season, he‚Äôll only need to average¬†**16.2 points**¬†per game to pass Kareem. But Bron won‚Äôt play every game, so let‚Äôs adjust.

Last season Lebron played in¬†**56 games**. If he repeats this trend, he‚Äôll need to average¬†**23.7 points**. Now that‚Äôs doable! In all likelihood, we will see [The King](https://youtu.be/Pk8aSaYcd9k) pass Abdul-Jabbar sometime around the 60th game of the season in February or March. We can‚Äôt wait to witness greatness!

Random: Did you know that [LeBron](https://enjoybasketball.beehiiv.com/p/players-crossroads) technically has already passed Kareem in terms of total points in the regular season¬†*and*¬†playoffs? Apparently, people only care about regular season points, which honestly seem less relevant.",0.84
