Just out of curiosity, I remember several months ago that the Lakers and a few other teams were looking to pick up Tyreke Evans (after he got reinstated back into the league). Time went on and it sort of slipped my mind until now. Watching the game last night brought up memories of past Kings players, and immediately I went ""Oh yeah, where the hell is Evans these days? What happened to him?""


I YouTube searched some recent videos of him from over the off-season training and doing open gym games. Looks healthy and able to play. Still only 33yo and he has experienced PG skills as a scorer and facilitator. Plus he has actual size at PG to defend and switch. Just curious if anyone else had wondered why Evans hasn't been getting a look. Is he that cooked? Even Isaiah Thomas got a few more chances to play in the league before Evans did. He surely has to be better than Beverly and Nunn, right?",1.0
