Rob's name is getting thrown around a lot right now (and understandably so). But I'm genuinely curious - what more could he have done this summer (other than the Hield deal) to improve our shooting? Not trying to defend Rob, I've just been kind of out of the loop (can you blame a guy if a historically bad season makes him lose interest?).

Or is the case that there weren't many reliable, realistic options this summer and the Rob vitriol is still just about him gutting and blowing up the 2020 squad in the first place?",0.84

21,2022-10-21 04:45:30,y9k2hq,LAL vs LAC game analysis,Saransh69,"1) The Lakers really need to let AD play at the 4 and pair him with a  center. 

Case in point: Zubac looked like a better version of Dennis Rodman out there with how many offensive boards he grabbed and the amount of 2nd chance opportunities he created. Can't allow that many O-boards.

Also, one way to make up for the insane amount of 3 pointers missed is to crash the offensive boards with intensity like the Memphis Grizzlies do. Getting a center will help with that. 

2) This roster needs some revamp fast and quick. 

Case in point: If the Lakers shot even sub 30% from three they probably win this game.

3) Russell Westbrook was decent tonight.

Case in point: He was horrendous offensively scoring 2 points on 0/0/100 but had like at least 10 good defensive possesions. 

Had like 5 steals (not sure how many the box score shows), had good hands on the perimeter, defended Kawhi very well in the post, stripping him twice and forcing a travel. 

If he can be this good defensively while also being decent on offense the Lakers could make a push for the 7th/8th seed.

Remember, these first two games were against most probably the two best teams in the west. And they managed to make them a little close which means they can probably win against teams who are in the middle of the pack and the bad tanking teams.

4) LeBron and AD.

LeBron was obviously excellent throughout the game, I only disliked one play from him in the entire game. 

And that one was in the fourth quarter where he passed to Russ on the 3 pt line while he had Luke Kennard on him. 

Though it may have been the correct play since if LeBron took Kennard off the dribble or posted him up Zubac would've immediately helped since he was already sagged way off Russ.

AD could've been better on the glass but he was obviously playing through pain after that hard fall so not his fault. He was also great.

5) Darvin Ham coaching decision 

The Lakers brought the game back in the 3rd quarter with the lineup of Pat Bev - Reaves -Walker -JTA- LeBron. 

I understand putting in AD because the defense of this lineup was probably not going to be sustainable if it was played for majority of the 4th quarter and closing minutes but Russell Westbrook had no business closing the game. 

While he made excellent defensive plays and racked up stop after stop, his presence was also a huge factor as to why the Lakers were unable to convert defense into offense.

Obviously the biggest reason for that is the lack of 3 pt shooting but he's a contributor to that. In conclusion, Lakers need Buddy Hield and Myles Turner badly.",0.68
