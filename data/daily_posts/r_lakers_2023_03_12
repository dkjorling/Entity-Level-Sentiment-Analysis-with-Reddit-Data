AD needs to step the fuck up. While the team around him may be better, by no means does that mean he needs to take a step back. Honestly step the fuck up. AD you are our guy. 
Ham schemed this game bad. Who is setting up plays for these dudes? 

I love this team and want to see them succeed. But this was a poor excuse of a gem from AD and Ham. Step the fuck up. We won‚Äôt, and don‚Äôt deserve, to make the playoffs if this is how they are going to go at games. Fucking pathetic. 

This is mainly for Ham and a little bit of AD. I know he has played well when healthy besides these last two games, but honestly hearing his postgame discouraged me. Be the monster you are AD.

Granted the 3 ball isn't falling and it was a complete mess of a 4th except for that last minute where our Lakers played basketball (if only we could extend the 4th quarter). This loss sucks since this could have made us .500. But maybe that Toronto game made us feel complacent, I know some of you guys will be overreacting like ""It's Ham's fault or AD ain't playing like AD or some sort of trade Beasley"". But I'd like to believe that our guys know what's at stake and they hate it the same as we do.

Gordon has more experience, but is also much older. Beasley can be streaky, but is also much younger which bodes better long term. Gordon can pull from very very deep, and stretching the floor that deep for guys like Bron and AD is a big plus in my book. 

I think for longevity, the answer is obviously Beasley, but what about for trying to win in this small Lebron James window?
