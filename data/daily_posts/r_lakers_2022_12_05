He is on track for a 50/40/90 season. He‚Äôs also a decent ball handler and distributor. I believe he can do great things with the ball in his hands. 

I don‚Äôt know why Schroder is the point guard in those lineups where Russ is on the bench. Give the ball the Reaves, let him drive it so he can get to the free throw line, let him distribute for stretches in the game. Reaves is useless when standing in the corner.

But for the Lakers to achieve meaningful playoff success, we need much more than 15/7/7 for $47M in salary, especially in the playoffs when Russ has historically performed worse.

Coming into the season the goal was to stay afloat before a Russ trade and if possible restore some of Russ‚Äô trade value. Miraculously that‚Äôs what we have accomplished thus far. We are one Pacer‚Äôs win away from .500 amidst a brutal schedule and historically bad luck, and Russ has demonstrated he‚Äôs still a player that can at least contribute to regular season winning.

41,2022-12-05 10:59:43,zd3tn0,How to turn the Lakers into contenders: play through AD with RWB running the offense and LBJ being our defense anchor.,ProRainmaker,"Hear me out.  

I think we should be running AD as our primary option (ala 2000 Shaq) with RWB being our playmaker (ala 80s Magic) and LeBron our hound guard (ala 2000 Kobe or 2010 Artest/MWP).  

First thing-AD.

I think I will skimp over, but I think the last 10 games clearly showed us what playing through AD can mean for us.  

Now onto RWB.  

I absolutely hated it when everyone was calling RWB busted, useless and worthless.  No, he isn't.  Obviously he isn't at his MVP level, but he remains a very good player.  

I find it ridiculous that everyone forgets that the season before he came to the Lakers, he was averaging 22/12/12 and dragged a bad Wizards team back into the playoffs; granted they were eliminated in the first round easily.  It's funny that a player that did something like this lands on a team and suddenly becomes a cancer. 

The problem with LBJ's teams is that everyone else kind of relegates to a more passive role.  It happened with Bosh and it happened with Love.  Wade and Irving also had to take half a step back. 

Look, before all the LBJ fans come snapping at me, yes, LBJ was and still is a great player.  But he doesn't exactly magnify his teammates' strengths, he doesn't make them better.  In terms of team's output, he is more of a MJ/Kobe/Iverson type-he needs others to cover his flaws.  He is not Magic, Stockton or Isiash Thomas (Detroit).  Yes, he's creeping up the assists list but that's because he is able to pull defenders to him and then make the good pass out.  That doesn't mean he is able to amplify his teammate's strengths.  But again, that doesn't mean him a lesser player, just a different player.  

Now that we finally realize that AD can be a beast if we play through him, we need to realize that RWB can make us contenders-yes, contenders.  

Off-the-bench RWB is good, because he was given free reign.  And that's what he needs to be doing, not jacking 3s in an offense oriented around LBJ.  Look at what he did for us today-15 assists with 10 going to AD.  Anyone who says RWB is selfish is clearly simply reading tabloid news.  RWB is the best person to run alongside AD-a PG who is fearless and an able passer.  

And now here comes the crux-why not AD/LBJ but AD/RWB?  What's the advantage?  

No, there isn't really an advantage.  RWB feeding into AD or LBJ feeding into AD are around the same levels; you can argue otherwise for either, although most will claim the latter will be a better combo which I will claim is due to recency bias, but screw it, let's go with that claim.

The difference is, LBJ is miles better on defence.  By giving RWB the keys to the offense, we solve the problem of him playing or not playing.  On the other hand, we can keep LeBron fresh on defense and he will be our defense anchor.

Now, let's do a 22 years flashback.  The 2000 Lakers won on the back of Shaq simply destroying everything in the way.  However, they were also anchored by a very strong defensive stopper in Kobe.  We can literally clone this recipe with AD playing the role of Shaq and LBJ that of Kobe.  Keeping LBJ fresh as third option is also great because on days that AD is off (eg 2000 WCF Game 7, 2000 NBA Finals Game 4), LBJ can burst onto the scene and do what Kobe did for us.  

We have a recipe for success.  An exact clone duplicate.  

We asked at the start of the season-do we dare to bench RWB?

Now the question can be-do we dare to ask LBJ to step down?",0.5
