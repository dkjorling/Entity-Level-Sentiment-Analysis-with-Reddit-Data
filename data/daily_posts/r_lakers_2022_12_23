21,2022-12-24 01:10:06,ztxx9y,"[Rant]So how isn‚Äôt AD‚Äôs injury being stress related, Bron‚Äôs abundance of wear and tear injuries over the course of being a laker, and now Russ‚Äôs knee soreness not indicative of this front offices failure?",Freeeecurry,"I get it. Bron is older. Fuck Solomon Hill. Now that we got that out the way, you must be ignorant if you don‚Äôt think this front office forcing 36+ minute games on a 38 year old in year 20 has done nothing but fucked up to build out the roster or fix it marginally. 

Before you say, ‚ÄúOh but freeeecurry‚ÄùBron had the option to sign the extension‚Äù, no he was lied to and manipulated into thinking the lakers brass would use the picks to be competitive. 

Their main intention of signing Bron was to have Bron break the scoring record as a laker, this is equivocal to a chip for Jeannie and a big enough moral victory in order her to justify to continue not spending marginal amounts of money so AD, Lebron, and Russ all end their careers sooner than they should have because Jeannie decided to run them into the ground Thibbs style. 

Now we have proof that she is just running players into the ground instead of just fixing the roster even marginally. She can‚Äôt even cut Damian to bring someone in who can actually rebound and give AD help. 

I and all other fans should place the cumulative blame on to Jeannie and raise awareness. She wants you all to think of Bron as washed king, Ad as day to day, and Russ as Westbrick because she continues being cheap as long as there are other scapegoats.

28,2022-12-23 22:24:43,ztufhw,"You are the Lakers GM, what do you do now that AD is hurt for the 100th time?",Magic_SnakE_,"Please correct me if any of this information is incorrect.

Anthony Davis, after playing the best basketball we've seen from him since the bubble, is unsurprisingly hurt again. Out indefinitely. It is painfully obvious at this point he will not be able to stay healthy. Historically, big men do not age well and he's been dealing with injury issues his entire career. It will likely only get WORSE moving forward, with his production likely dropping too.

His contract runs through the 24-25 season..

LeBron James has just this season left on his contract, though he is ""expected"" to sign for another 2 years.

Russell Westbrooks contract is up after this season.

Salvation via free agency is very unlikely, considering the best free agents coming up in 2023 are:  
\- Khris Middleton (Cannot see him leaving the Bucks)  
\- James Harden (Cannot see him leaving Philly or signing with the Lakers)  
\- Kyrie Irving (Don't see him leaving KD, but if he did we do know what he and LeBron can do together)  
\- Kristaps Porzingis (Another injury prone big)

If it's me, I'm looking to trade Anthony Davis along with our picks and anyone else, to get a star level player to pair with Bron. If no team will go for that, then we go for a fringe star level player that has youth, health, and potential.

If LeBron doesn't like that, then we work to respectfully move on from both him and AD and get as many picks and prospects as possible, and we fully begin the rebuild process.

Then I use the rest of the available money I have to fill out the roster with players who aren't Kendrick Nunn or Patrick Beverly.

Yeah, it's a damn shame that this isn't working out with Bron and AD, but they did win a championship together, that's special. But it's time to move on from AD. If that means Bron has to go, so be it.
