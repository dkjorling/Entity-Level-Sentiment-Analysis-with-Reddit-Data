1,2023-04-08 05:53:41,12fd4p1,Lakers should‚Äôve never got Lebron,Ok_Dog_7476,"Lakers messed up their rebuild by getting Lebron back in 2018 and letting all their good draft picks go to other teams.

Almost every player we‚Äôve drafted in the last decade is now improved &amp; a star on another team. Brandon Ingram, Julius Randle, Jordan Clarkson, Kyle Kuzma. Even Lonzo Ball could‚Äôve been a great backup PG for D‚ÄôAngelo or 6th man. Zubac was another pick we lost to LAC and he‚Äôs not that bad either. 

Now instead of being a young team like Memphis, OKC or Boston, we‚Äôre a team that only has a couple years left of being successful. Lebron wont play more than 2 years and I‚Äôm sure AD will leave when he does. Then what? 

Lebron should‚Äôve never came.",1.0

Im taking that Warriors is locked in 5th spot.
If Warriors drop their last game and Pels, Lakers and  Clips all win, warriors will slide to 8th.


If Clippers drops one of there last 2 games,
And Pelicans and Lakers win both their respective games.

Three way tie where:
Pelicans 4-3
Clippers 4-3
Lakers 3-5

Pelicans goes to 6th
Clippers to 7th
Lakers to 8th",1.0
3,2023-04-08 05:29:39,12fcp7e,"We officially have the 7/8th spot secured! Meaning, we will only have to win 1 out of 2 games to make the playoffs.",atierney14,"Our current situation is us tied with the Pelicans at 42-39. If we win out, we are guaranteed the 7th spot, but given that the 9th spot Twolves are at 40-40 and they play the Pelicans the worst scenarios if we lose to the Jazz, we will end up 42-40. 

If: 

- Pelicans win out, putting them at 43-39, 1 game above us, but since they play the Twolves, the most the Twolves could win if they lose against the Pelicans is 41, a game below us. We would be the 8th seed. 

- Twolves win out, putting all of us at 42-40, with a three way tie. 

Per the NBA rules, when there is a three way tie, the tie breaker is the highest win percentage among games of the three teams. 

a. We are 3-1 vs NOP (thanks to Matt Ryan) and 1-2 vs Minnesota, 4-3, a win percentage of 57%. 

b. NoP are 1-3 vs us, and if they lose to the TWolves, they‚Äôll end up at 1-2 vs them, or 2-5, a win percentage of 28%. 

c. Minnesota would be the best, 4-2, making them 7, and we would be 8th seed.


So we are currently going to end anywhere from 6-8th, not bad given our start. 

We‚Äôre 6th if we win and the Warriors blow their last game. 

We‚Äôre 7th if we win and the Warriors win. 

8th if we lose and the Twolves win out or if we lose and the Pelicans beat the Twolves.",1.0

19,2023-04-08 02:48:02,12f8ypj,We could still get the 6th seed even if Warriors beat Kings tonight: Here's why,monks-cat,"It all depends on what the Clippers do on their last games or two . If they decide to throw one of them in order to not play the Suns, this could spiral into the Warriors throwing their game. The reason being, the Warriors may prefer a 7th seed then face the Suns in the first round. They know they can at least win 1 of 2 games at home. 

&amp;#x200B;

 I know Ty Lue said they are just trying to win, but most coaches will say that in that situation. When it comes down to the final game, if there's a lot of organizational top down pressure to win (there is), they might rightfully decide that the Suns are clearly the toughest team in the West right now and no one wants to see them in the first round. Subsequent rounds there's a good chance they will be hurt, just being real.",1.0

Problem with Ham is he just leaves Vanderbilt to stand on the corner 3 point line. Unacceptable in today‚Äôs NBA to have a non-shooter do nothing but stand on the corner and shoot. Other teams just dare Vanderbilt to shoot, so they leave him to double team AD in the post.

Jackson on the other hand understood that Rodman is a rebounder and best used around the paint. Phil doesn‚Äôt have Rodman just standing on the corner, instead he keeps him constantly in motion by playing Rodman on the elbow around the paint to set screens, to play handoff on curls, and cuts to the basket for layups or offensive rebounds making Rodman an efficient part of the Bulls‚Äô offense.

Surely, Ham can get Vanderbilt to do the same?",1.0
