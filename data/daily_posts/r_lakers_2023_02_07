IIRC Davis just picked up his 4th foul and Ham took him out and Lebron was at 34 pts about to get 36.

IMO this makes the most sense why Davis was pissed off and pouting the rest of the game and seen sitting down when Lebron broke the recording. He's probably big mad at Ham for taking him out and decided to pout the rest of the game.

Should've just let him stay in the game until Lebron reached it.",1.0

I think the impending deadline has everyone in their head - even Bron and AD to a degree. Bron was out there playing for the scoring record but once he broke it he kinda went silent. AD had probably his worst game of the season so far.

The reason I say this is because this gave me loss in Portland against their g league team from last year, which was also right before the deadline. 

Again I have to imagine the tension permeated the locker room and had an impact on the energy and effort. It felt like there was a similar effect in New Orleans on Saturday.

The move is yours, Rob",1.0

117,2023-02-08 00:58:47,10wirgw,A sleeper trade that we can make for more wing depth,1of1czr,Chuma Okeke from the Orlando magic is probably easy to obtain without giving up too much in return. He‚Äôs out of the magic rotation as the magic have too many young forwards to give their minutes to. He‚Äôs a young 6‚Äô8 3&amp;D type of player and I think he‚Äôs exactly what we‚Äôre looking for as he‚Äôs not ball dominant and can guard the opponents best wing and hit a 3 when we need him to. Now the only thing is he got injured in November and they said his timetable is a month. It‚Äôs February now and he still isn‚Äôt back so maybe the injury is more serious or the magic are taking it slow bringing him back since Isaac just returned as well so they‚Äôre in no rush for him. Anyway I think 1 or 2 second rounders might be enough to get him and he‚Äôd be a nice addition to the team and give us more height And shooting,1.0

130,2023-02-07 19:21:37,10wahy1,Filling the Gaps,NotKemoSabe,"Hopefully this will be a change of pace from the endless trade idea threads.

We don't need a third superstar. We need to solidify the ranks if you will with solid role players who fit a specific purpose. 

In 2019 - 2020 we had the following players

LeBron

AD

Kuzma

KCP

Danny Green

Markieff Morris

Kuzma

Caruso

McGee

Dwight

Rondo

These were the players that brought us a ring in 2019-2020. 

Who on this years roster fills the roles provided by these players.

LeBron = Still LeBron just a couple of years older.

AD = Still AD. Maybe better when he is healthy.

Kuzma = Rui fills this role to an extent. Troy Brown Jr as well. 

KCP = ????

Danny Green = ?????

Markieff Morris = Rui fills this role to an extent.

Caruso = Reeves fills this role to an extent. Beverley fills this role to an extent

McGee = ?????

Dwight = Thomas Bryant fills this role to an extent.

Rondo = Dennis Schroder 

Dudley = Beverley fills this role to an extent

Please feel free to add your own but notice how Westbrook, Walker, and Jones don't seem to really fill any role and we don't seem to have a Danny Green or KCP. 

Have at it.....",1.0

133,2023-02-07 16:53:23,10w6ox5,Wouldn't we rather have Clarkson instead of Conley? And Olynyk instead of Vanderbilt?,Zodraz,"We need a PG who can get their own shot -- that's not Conley, it's Clarkson.

And Vanderbilt has a lot of promise, but we need a veteran big man who knows how to play team defense and can shoot threes -- that's Olynyk.

So I think this is the best plausible Westbrook trade with Utah:

To Jazz | To Lakers | 2023-24 Contract Status
:-: | :-: | :-:  
Westbrook | Beasley | Team Option (16.5 M)
D. Jones | Olynyk | Team Option (12.2 M, 3 M guaranteed)
2029 first (unprotected) | Clarkson | Player Option (14.3 M)
 | U. Azubuike | Unrestricted Free Agent

The nice thing about this is we can still create a lot of cap space this summer:   

(a) Clarkson is almost certainly going to decline his option and become a free agent,   

(b) only 3 M of Olynyk's 2023-2024 salary is guaranteed (so it can be stretched to just a 1M cap hit over the next three years), and  

(c) Beasley's contract has no partial guarantee -- it's a full team option.

(d) The Jazz declined their fourth-year option on Azuibuke's rookie contract, so he's an UFA (I just included him so that we could get rid of Jones' contract for next year).  

So not only does this combination of players improve us the most this year, it also gives us the most free agent flexibility this summer...

139,2023-02-07 08:50:24,10vx4rh,Why I Wouldn‚Äôt Mind Mike Conley and the Utah Deal,BlueRaj,"The rumored Utah package (Mike Conley, Malik Beasley, Jarred Vanderbilt) personally really moves me, specifically if it really is only for one first-round pick.

I really like Conley‚Äôs fit next to Lebron and AD. Now yes, his contract IS bad. He IS older. He IS a 6‚Äô1‚Äù guard. These are all valid concerns. However, he‚Äôs about as sound and stable of a floor general as any team could ask for. Over the last four seasons he‚Äôs shot roughly 37-41% from three on 5-6 attempts. He plays well both on-ball AND off-ball. He‚Äôs genuinely still a sound and disciplined defender. He‚Äôs obviously not the defender he once was, but you could argue he‚Äôs between neutral to slightly positive on that end. He certainly makes up for Russ‚Äôs playmaking whilst also being a shooter with solid defense. He would be a $22 million expiring next year as well, which isn‚Äôt impossible to flip if necessary.

If we also do some other trade that sends out Beverley+Lonnie, our only small guards would be Schroeder and Conley, which is perfectly fine.

Beasley is a high-volume, movement shooter with a team option next season. Vanderbilt is a very good defender with size and a very good feel for rebounding. He‚Äôs only 23 too!

Especially if we also flip Beverley+Lonnie, I really like this Utah package (even more than the Toronto one since it would likely cost a lot more). That being said, I am going to keep my expectations super low and not expect anything. If, by some chance, we really do go for this move though, I would personally be very happy.

TLDR: Conley and the rest of the Utah package would actually go a long ways in rounding out this team.",1.0
