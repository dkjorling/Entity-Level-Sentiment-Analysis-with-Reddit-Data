2,2022-10-13 01:28:14,y2lnvm,I love the underdog mentality that we have. And I think this will lead to our championship.,junahn,"This year, bleacherreport, espn and other media predicted lakers to be at 9th seed in the West, above other tanking teams. And none of them are expecting us to win the chip nor the health of our main guys. 

And I can see that everyone in our roster are committed to teamwork, defense, and hustles that we couldn't see last year. Lebron and Russ seemed to be more willing on playing defense and AD worked dead hard on his shooting. We got more glue guys, Reaves from last year, Beverly, JTA, Christie to contribute for the team's success. 

Under Lebron James's leadership(And lebron always thrived when his team was underappreciated and considered as underdogs) I solely believe that this team can top all the team in the playoffs, and I dont care who we meet in the playoffs too. Warriors, clippers, nuggets, timberwolves, whatever. 

And I am calling this team to win the title. Although it might be a little early, as a fan, I just believe that unless you support tanking team you should believe your team no matter what circumstances.",0.58

8,2022-10-13 03:35:10,y2oa1l,I hate 4 guard basketball,3nnui,"Ugly first half, we shoot 2-18 from 3. Naz Reid looking to put up 40. Edwards and Dlo able to bully their matchup to any spot on the floor they want then raise up for an easy shot, and if AD comes over, then another ez bucket for Reid. We cannot secure defensive rebounds. Wolves getting easy transition points even when we are back because they are all 4 inches taller and 30 pounds heavier at every position but 5. I think the poor 3 point shooting is a function of being tired from boxing out, and having a larger defender able to close out and contest without worrying about the drive because plenty of help inside if they fly by.

I guess JTA is not going to play this game, he would help a lot. But I would rather see Wenyen take the floor at the 4 or play the centers more, so we are not looking at mismatches across the board. In some cases 4 guard basketball can work, when people are tired, when you need to make a comeback. But going with it early emboldens the other team to play aggressively and punish you on every play. This was the worst looking basketball of the preseason so far other than some blowouts of the south bay guys in the 3rd quarter. 

I hope we don't do this again.",0.89

Vogel spent the entire season shuffling everything trying to recapture the dominance of the Lakers 2020 championship team to no avail, folks, it looks like we're heading in the same direction with Ham.

In 2020 the Lakers were an average 3-pt shooting team in the regular season. 


In the 2020 Playoffs: the reason our shooting went up is the % for our players did: AD 38%, Lebron 37%, Markief Morris 42%, Rondo 40%, KCP 37%


That season was a statistical outlier because half those guys had career years from 3 and players don‚Äôt just beat their career record every year


In 2021, The Lakers fell apart in the playoffs because they could not make a single 3.


2021- 2022 Szn we missed the playoffs, our shooting was a little better but our offensive lineups and defense were terrible. 


Can we honestly say that the front office has prioritized shooting? To me they just got lucky in 2020 and since then the shooting is terrible bc the personelll are not great 3-or shooters

Since Russ can't seem to be a starter who gives Ham the disciplined-energy that the team needs defensively --what if Russ pulls a Rondo? And embraces the 2nd unit greatly? So greatly, to whereas when they enter the game...his *triple-double style* is now a delight!

Kobe Bean Bryant has just concluded his career with a 60-piece masterpiece, the Lakers have poached the Warriors Assistant Luke Walton to succeed Byron Scott as their tank commander, and legendary GM Mitch Kupchak has given Timofey Mozgov and Luol Deng $136 million over the next four years to keep the bench warm and iron Walton‚Äôs suits

The Lakers first meme team is manned by Julius Beyblade Randle, D-loading, an emaciated Kevin Durant (Brandon Ingram), [Marcelo Huertas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WZpysiobzw), Nick Young, and Metta World Peace. Even [Kobe knows](https://youtu.be/OCZ3DhCLpBc?t=133) the future is bleak.

Due to the [Steve Nash trade](https://lakeshowlife.com/2018/05/22/los-angeles-lakers-trade-for-steve-nash-finally-ending-in-2018-draft/) (and others), the Lakers owe a 2017 top-3 protected pick to the 76ers, which if it conveys, [also costs them a 2019 first round pick](https://orlandomagicdaily.com/2017/05/16/orlando-magic-will-pick-sixth-2017-nba-draft/) to the Magic. **If ever there was a year to tank, this was it.**

A player of the [Allen Iverson small scoring guard mold](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEFPWpu85_Y), he is the bench microwave, the guy who‚Äôs hotter than fish grease, and the legend with [two girlfriends](https://www.basketballnetwork.net/latest-news/lou-williams-opens-up-on-having-two-girlfriends-at-the-same-time).

What makes him deadly? High specialties include running the pick and roll, drawing fouls, and scoring in bunches. In the 2016-2017 season, he ran the pick and roll better than Chris Paul, drew fouls like James Harden, and scored as efficiently as prime Michael Jordan.

But what makes him *really* deadly? The man has [absolutely](https://twitter.com/TeamLou23/status/830325440426471424) [no regard](https://www.opencourt-basketball.com/lou-williams-lakers-traded-refused-tank/) [for tanking](https://lakersnation.com/lou-williams-explains-why-lakers-wont-tank/2017/02/12/).

# Lou Williams - the Pick Destroyer

It all started with Luke Walton, a now recognized idiot, realizing that Lou Williams is an offensive genius, and letting him wreak havoc with his fast-paced chucking offense. And Sweet Lou was magnificent on the attack.

**Drawing Fouls**

That season, Lou Williams was the third best foul drawing guard, after Spencer Dinwiddie and above James Harden. He was especially adept at drawing three point fouls. According to ESPN, as of 2019, Lou has drawn the [third-most three point fouls since the 1999-2000 season](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/26662160/the-sour-science-driving-james-harden-vexing-genius#:~:text=249-,Lou). He was [Prince of the Foul](https://twitter.com/BenGolliver/status/685709812567420928).

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/geg0ehsavdu91.png?width=886&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5ea4ff3e17c86de7cf09bc1629b6629b974c2a36

**Going Left**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wg97devivdu91.png?width=350&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b54baef0ccd36edf4a2102fdd729e2576922208a

Lou loved shooting going left, especially in the mid-range. Also, notice those corner threes? Lou shot 51% (30/59) from the corner three that season.

Speaking of offensive efficiency, Lou ranked in the 97th percentile in offensive usage and the 98th percentile in points per attempt, at 1.233 points per shooting attempt, **trailing only James Harden among all shooting guards.**

According to [NBA.com](http://nba.com/) play tracking, Lou was the 6th best isolation player (1.1 points per play) and the best pick-and-roll handler by points-per-play among all players (1.07 points per play). **In other words, Lou was more efficient as both an isolation and pick-and-roll ballhandler than the Golden State Warriors with the newly acquired Kevin Durant.**

**Leading the bench unit**

Lou was part of 3 out of the 4 best Laker lineups that season, including a bench mob of Lou, Jordan Clarkson, Brandon Ingram, Larry Nance Jr. and Tarik Black that [blitzed teams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-LNrG_dy7Y) by

* Attacking defenses early, in isolation and with a variety of screens.
* Breaking down defenses with their drive-and-kick game.
* Nance and Black putting pressure on the defense by being mobile, high energy, rim-running, and setting screens.
* Playing surprisingly good defense.

The Lakers‚Äô bench during Lou Williams‚Äô tenure was the highest scoring bench by a [WIDE margin](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask?q=what+nba+team+has+the+highest+scoring+bench+between+10%2F26%2F16+and+02%2F21%2F17).

Lou also set records as a reserve, including [the record for most point scored in 4 games by an NBA reserve](https://www.espn.com/nba/recap?gameId=400899786) (despite his best efforts, the Lakers lost those four games). [Here's Lou talking about the bench's success.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy0FY77fAz4)

**Secrit Play with Huertas**

Finally, I need to shoutout the Lakers‚Äô secrit play, first run by Williams and Huertas to perfection.

* And later by D-lo and ingram [https://streamable.com/qfzn8](https://streamable.com/qfzn8)

**The Damage**

In total, with Lou Williams ON the floor, the Lakers had a point differential of a 45-win team. With him OFF the floor, they played like a 14-win team. [ESPN Real Plus-Minus estimates](http://www.espn.com/nba/statistics/rpm/_/year/2017/sort/WINS#:~:text=34,6.79) **that Lou Williams‚Äô total impact that year was 6.79 wins. The Lakers finished 6 wins ahead of the last place 76ers.** You do the math.

In other words, Lou was winning us games we were supposed to be losing, while providing a show. It was beautifully painful, refreshingly baller, and unfortunately almost ruined the Lakers' rebuild.

On February 21, the Lakers fired GM Kupchak and named Tragic Johnson as President of basketball operations. Two days later, Lou Williams was traded for a 2017 Houston first round pick and Corey Brewer during All Star Weekend (Daryl Morey, the GOAT GM). Two weeks later, Rob Pelinka was hired as GM, and the Lakers next chapter truly began.

&amp;#x200B;

**All is well in Lakerland**

The picks associated with the Lou Williams anti-tank missile include the Lakers 2017 1st round pick ([Lonzo Ball](https://youtu.be/MHmX2xnH-sU?t=230)), their 2019 1st round pick, and a 2017 1st round pick from the Rockets. The 2017 Rockets pick was traded to the Utah Jazz for two picks, which they used to select Josh Hart and Thomas Bryant.

These assets: **Lonzo, Josh Hart, and the 2019 pick (later, De‚ÄôAndre Hunter), were core pieces in the 2019 Anthony Davis trade**, in addition to Brandon Ingram and three picks.

Lou Williams continued his offensive brilliance in Houston, and later the Los Angeles Clippers. He continued to terrorize the Lakers, averaging **2**5.75 PPG in the next **2** seasons against them (his average during the same span was **2**0.47 PPG.

He would also win Western Conference Player of the week **twice** in **2**018, and 6th Man of the Year **twice** as well. Ironically, he and one of his **two** girlfriends broke up in **2**0**2**0, proving Lou is basically just like the rest of us.

And the Lakers, as you all know, won a championship in **2**0**2**0 with Anthony Davis, arguably Lebron‚Äôs best No. **2** option in his career. Does NBA history rhyme? **Too** much, if you ask me.

**The Lou Williams anti-tank award**

Which player this season will get hot and anti-tank their team? The Magic, Hornets, Spurs, Rockets, Jazz, and Thunder are likely tank candidates. Maybe Terry Rozier, Josh Richardson, Eric Gordon, Jordan Clarkson (taking on Lou‚Äôs legacy). What do you all think?

He can personally increase his value by playing nice, and acting right for his next contract. As far as his value to the Lakers, it will only rise as time goes on, and will peak at the trade deadline. There seems to be 2 locks in this years draft and at least half a dozen teams that will be trying to improve their odds. That's probably why Rob is finally doing something right. Why include drafts now, when several teams will be motivated to make moves later? Nobody, the Lakers could trade for, can correct all the current issues.

A hamstring injury will force Westbrook to play slower and more controlled, and I think he‚Äôs shown he can be effective when playing like this. If he comes out of the gates playing slower, I think Ham and the rest of the coaching staff will take notice of the difference it makes, leading to permanent adjustments to Westbrook‚Äôs role and playstyle that actually benefit the team as long as he‚Äôs here.

I bought tickets to see Clippers-Suns this Sunday and managed to grab a DEAL on courtside seats (I'm a Kawhi fan, and with that much talent on the floor, why not). Bought off Vividseats, received the confirmation email right away but never received actual tickets; they should've popped up in my AXS app. Thought it was strange until I received a following email telling me to call them as immediate action is needed.

The guy on the phone proceeded to tell me the tickets were either ""lost"" or the transaction didn't go through, even though the money was taken from my account and I got a confirmation email for the seats. Funny also because I see the exact same seats I bought on their site for triple the price. Then he says the best he could do is a replacement for the seats of equal value for what I paid (way further) or a full refund + store credit which I don't want. I want the seats I paid for.

My question is: has anyone ever dealt with anything like this? What recourse do I have -- can I escalate it somehow?

Guy on the phone said he was the highest agent and that there was nothing else he could do.

I'm 99% certain the seller of the tickets contacted them to pull the transaction because they listed them too low. Feel pretty ripped off.

If anyone has any advice, please let me know. Thanks.

TDLR; Don't trust vividseats/AXS. Will ""lose"" your tickets after purchase and offer you shittier seats and $5 towards Crypto's overpriced merch in exchange.

Let me know as well if this is violating any rules.

So what the hell are the Lakers doing?

Let's be completely honest here, there's no realistic trade this year, there's no free agent next year, that's going to turn this team around and make us contenders again.  Best-case scenario, and we are an early playoff exit team. 

Our #1 guys is getting older and getting fed up (just watch his post-game conference from opening night).  Lebron has never asked for a trade from any team he's been on, but I wouldn't be shocked if he does this year. 

Our #2 guy is injury-prone and is playing like it.  Still talented sure, but is he really who you're building your team around?  ... and what a team they've built around those two.  A bunch of minimum salary players who play like a bunch of minimum salary players.   Then there's Westbrook... do I really need to get into that?

So what the hell are we doing?  Trading for Buddy Heild, Turner, Poetl, whatever names have come up is not going to make us contenders.  We need to face the reality that the Jazz faced up to, and they were in a much better situation.   Let's trade AD and Bron while they have some value.   We keep Westbrook and let his contract expire and we start clean next season.  It's painful yes, but why prolong the inevitable.  Are we going to wait until AD gets hurt AGAIN and his trade value drops more?  Or are we going to wait until father time finally smacks Lebron in the face or he walks when his current deal is over?

We have to be more pragmatic than that.",0.64

Been a Laker fan for as long as I can remember as do many in this channel, we‚Äôve gone through the exciting times of Kareem, Magic‚Äòs first game, into the 80‚Äôs, the magic years of purple and gold, seeing riley‚Äôs hair and how we battled the Pistons, Celtics and Bulls.  As we look back and compare our dear Lakers today, it saddens me to see how this franchise is being run with disregard.  What we saw the other day against the Warriors was a disgrace to the memory of Mr. Buss and the millions of fans around the world.  Even Lebron after the game mentioned ‚Äúwe are not a good shooting team‚Äù well why have we not gotten shooters around Lebron?  I could go on and on but wanted to hear our proud community and their thoughts on how we can improve and construct a solid team moving into the season.",0.81
234,2022-10-20 02:56:27,y8mczq,Can you not build a contender around Lebron anymore or is this team in too bad a situation to make it happen?,spankyourkopita,"Its really strange seeing a Lebron team not look competitive but that's become the norm  the last couple of years.  In the past you made sure you surrounded him with the best possible players to contend.

I haven't seen much decline but maybe it is a sign that Lebron ain't what he used to be. That or maybe we're stuck with this shitty roster and Lebron can't do anything about it. Its just crazy to think a repeat of last year might happen again.  It just feels like it.",0.35

Case in point: Zubac looked like a better version of Dennis Rodman out there with how many offensive boards he grabbed and the amount of 2nd chance opportunities he created. Can't allow that many O-boards.

Also, one way to make up for the insane amount of 3 pointers missed is to crash the offensive boards with intensity like the Memphis Grizzlies do. Getting a center will help with that. 

2) This roster needs some revamp fast and quick. 

Case in point: If the Lakers shot even sub 30% from three they probably win this game.

3) Russell Westbrook was decent tonight.

Case in point: He was horrendous offensively scoring 2 points on 0/0/100 but had like at least 10 good defensive possesions. 

Had like 5 steals (not sure how many the box score shows), had good hands on the perimeter, defended Kawhi very well in the post, stripping him twice and forcing a travel. 

If he can be this good defensively while also being decent on offense the Lakers could make a push for the 7th/8th seed.

Remember, these first two games were against most probably the two best teams in the west. And they managed to make them a little close which means they can probably win against teams who are in the middle of the pack and the bad tanking teams.

4) LeBron and AD.

LeBron was obviously excellent throughout the game, I only disliked one play from him in the entire game. 

And that one was in the fourth quarter where he passed to Russ on the 3 pt line while he had Luke Kennard on him. 

Though it may have been the correct play since if LeBron took Kennard off the dribble or posted him up Zubac would've immediately helped since he was already sagged way off Russ.

AD could've been better on the glass but he was obviously playing through pain after that hard fall so not his fault. He was also great.

5) Darvin Ham coaching decision 

The Lakers brought the game back in the 3rd quarter with the lineup of Pat Bev - Reaves -Walker -JTA- LeBron. 

I understand putting in AD because the defense of this lineup was probably not going to be sustainable if it was played for majority of the 4th quarter and closing minutes but Russell Westbrook had no business closing the game. 

While he made excellent defensive plays and racked up stop after stop, his presence was also a huge factor as to why the Lakers were unable to convert defense into offense.

Obviously the biggest reason for that is the lack of 3 pt shooting but he's a contributor to that. In conclusion, Lakers need Buddy Hield and Myles Turner badly.",0.68

However, as trash as Rob is, you guys do realize Jeanie is the one who extended him recently? I know it may be a long shot for Jeanie to actually sell the team. But I still believe the Buss family selling majority team stake (for billions of dollars) while retaining a minority stake could be a relative win-win for both fans and the Buss family. Even if she is unlikely to sell the team, I say we make that our chant until we see continued competence. To let our feelings be known. I wish #SellTheTeamJeanie was viral to apply some sort of pressure on our terrible and incompetent ownership/FO. 

I hear another Laker fan is trying to organize a protest and seeing a lot of people clowning him. If you can‚Äôt attend, fine. But why clown someone who is displaying passion? In fact, the last time Lakers‚Äô fans had a protest, we won the chip afterwards lol. Not to say that I could attend at all, but I prefer that type of fan over the ‚Äúfan‚Äù who is going to stop watching 10 games into our season. 

Final thought. Hopefully we don‚Äôt lose leverage as we wait to make a trade until closer to the deadline. I‚Äôve outlined the pros and cons of this strategy before. Pro: We may strike a better deal by waiting until we get closer to the trade deadline. Con: We may go 10-25 and already be out of it by then, especially with this tougher early schedule

I would like to see a good trade happen to get him outta here. BUT, until then i would like to see russ actually help the team in any way possible. 

When we got coach ham and he initially spoke about him wanting russ to be a defensive dog, ppl online actually ridiculed it and said russ has never been a defensive player in his whole career. Although this is true, id like to think throughout his while career up until now, he relied on his extreme athleticism to boost his offensive efforts and didnt feel the need to play defense. 

Even though russ is on the downtrend (to say it lightly), its still plain to see that he still possesses some of his athleticism. Since the start of the season, he has been playing well defensively and in high form this past game against the clippers. Imma go out on a limb here and say he could be doing the opposite to what hes been doing earlier in his career (offensively)  and using his athleticism to play defense instead.   

We are seeing russ‚Äô offense spiral uncontrollably down the toilet and maybe at some point he will recognize it. He may start to concentrate on honing his defense. I know it‚Äôs a long shot seeing how he‚Äôs been speaking in post games and his attitude in general, but I‚Äôm hopelessly optimistic. 

For example, look at lonnie walker, while playing for pop, he was basically a turn style on the defensive end. Him being so damn athletic, and ham pushing the defensive tenacity of the team, hes been playing very well and using his athletic ability to bolster his defense. Hes playing so well now. 

Some may disagree and i understand, but take a step back for a second and think how actual effort combined with athleticism contribute to being a good to excellent defender. If russ actually buys in, he could be a great asset for us while he‚Äôs here and could attract more teams to make offers.",0.37

Russ has been put in a bad spot but it‚Äôs clear he‚Äôs using that as an excuse to do whatever to escape accountability. Russ is being defended by Nurkic, at times vs the Clippers‚Ä¶Zubac. Why in the world is he not driving by players he‚Äôs faster than by a mile? What PG routinely chucks 3‚Äôs or contested 2‚Äôs when defended by a slow footed big man? Even Steph, the greatest shooter of all time, will get to the rack on a mismatch.

Westbrook has never had the best shot selection but it‚Äôs getting to the point he‚Äôs actively taking bad shots, giving poor effort, and doing anything that can contribute to a loss. And end of the day, he played ‚Äúgood‚Äù by his standards cause he‚Äôs cashing a check. I‚Äôm not a Lakers fan but this is embarrassing to the sport.

EDIT: Regarding the last play, I was so hung up on the shot selection, it didn‚Äôt even compute with me the worst thing about that play. Why the hell did he shoot it so early in the clock? You‚Äôre up 1 and you need to run the clock out before scoring again but no, about 5 seconds into the shot clock you‚Äôre chucking a contested 2? That‚Äôs peak tank right there.",0.93

490,2022-10-24 00:03:18,ybwvkp,The Russ Problem,Pure_Competition_481,"Imagine a safety leaving a receiver wide open to go double up on the other reciever because he knows that his assigned receiver can't catch the ball. The offense is now essentially playing with 1 less guy than the defense making it harder for the other receivers to get open and make catches. Now imagine playing 4 on 5 in basketball and that sums up the Russ experience so far. I didn't watch to much of the game tonight but I did keep up with it enough to see the same things I saw in the first 2 games. The Lakers obviously can't shoot and Russ definitely isn't the only problem the team needs to adress, but Russ is clearly the most glaring on court issue for this team. Teams literally  choosing to ignore Russ existence is simply unacceptable for a guy making 47 million. I've never seen a player hurt a team this way (granted I am fairly new to the basketball scene so I could be wrong about this), teams actually want Russ on the floor because it makes guarding Lebron and AD that much easier for them. They more specifically want Russ on the same side as Lebron and AD so they can just double one of the 2 with no repercussions if the lakers choose to do anything involving them. I mean Lebron and AD can pass it back to Russ but why do you think he's being left open in the first place? Because he's not even a half decent shooter so he'll more than likely miss it, a randomly sporadic passer so he will likely turn it over and a inefficient finisher at the rim which he can't get to anyway because that's where Lebron or AD are getting double teamed and he can't really shoot freethrows that well in the event that he does make it. Lebron and AD can't get much of any one on one action because of Russ lacking offensively in many parts of his game. There's no fear of an AD post up or Lebron drive when know you can abandon Russ and double up or clog the paint. The other players on the team can't shoot but they can finish at the rim, pass at a controlled rate and at least get enough respect to where their man isn't standing like 10-17 inches away. I also don't get why Ham is still playing Russ with all the ""earn it"" talk he was discussing before the season, especially in moments where the team is simply playing better basketball and winning without him. Maybe it's because he wants to prove that Russ can work, Maybe it's the Gm trying to get nonexistent trade value which won't work at all, or maybe Russ just holds more power than people thought. Either way he said he wasn't changing anything about how he plays and these are simply the results of that. Other than that tho I'm looking forward to joining this space I chose the Lakers because I liked the color scheme really so I guess I'm here for the ride now. Feel free to voice your opinions on this matter and say where you feel I'm wrong because I like seeing things from others perspectives. I also don't want to seem like a guy who just goes around bashing players on anything they do wrong, like if Russ stays I hope he can turn it around but I just don't feel like he can.

521,2022-10-24 03:35:06,yc129f,This Portland loss reminded me of the Patrick Beverley interview with Stephen A Smith earlier this summer,Joumbled,"While the early Westbrook shot at the end of the Portland game isn't the only reason the Lakers loss, it was an extremely boneheaded error. Even if he made the shot, it was a bad decision based on the timing and situation. Due to the recent comments made by Lebron and Ham, it reminded me of the interview of Patrick Beverley earlier this summer when he mentioned possibly going to the Lakers.

[https://youtu.be/JIBiYQbT-Zo?t=457](https://youtu.be/JIBiYQbT-Zo?t=457)  (7:37 - 8:38)

He essentially talked about leadership and accountability, specifically with Lebron and his defensive errors. But he also mentioned that he would talk to EVERYONE about mistakes in the game. Does anyone think that this has actually happened? Considering Pat Bev and Westbrook were essentially best friends at training camp, I think there's a shot, but we also have to think about the reluctance Westbrook has shown in ""sacrificing"" his game, changing roles, and taking ownership from mistakes with the media.

I just hope these conversations are actually happening INTERNALLY. Just like the recent Draymond Green situation and aftermath, things really should stay behind closed doors. It doesn't have to be brought up by Pat Bev, Lebron, or Coach Ham, but I just hope somebody speaks up.

Again, I don't think Russ lost the game with that possession. There are so many things the Lakers could have done differently and improve on, but I just hope that ALL mistakes and errors are properly communicated and proper accountability occurs. This includes all coaching mistakes, all basketball skills deficits, and all the things that prevent the team from winning basketball games.",0.68

549,2022-10-24 15:09:44,ycdqdh,We should be thankful for the brutal opening schedule and I‚Äôll tell you why,GreatAmerican1776,"Hear me out. The way I see it this season could have started one of two ways:

Scenario 1: Brutal opening schedule (and a key injury to Schroeder) leads to a record of 3-11 after 14 games. Coach Ham knows Westbrook is unplayable and continues forcing him into crucial game situations to leave no doubt that he either needs to made inactive or traded away as soon as possible. Schroeder comes back from injury just as Russ is traded away for shooting help and the Lakers surge to a .500 record by Christmas. A Christmas day win propels the team into the back half of the season and they become the team nobody wants to play in the playoffs.

Scenario 2: Hypothetical easy start to the season leaves the Lakers at 8-6 after 14 games. The record gives hope to the idea that Westbrook is good for the team and Lakers feel no urgency to change anything. This leads to a record of something like 23-35 at the all star break, at which point it is too late to fix anything. The team is now surrounded by bad vibes and ends up missing out on the play in game.

Now, we would all choose scenario 1, right? That‚Äôs where I‚Äôm at. I‚Äôm officially rooting for more embarrassing, painful losses that will force Pelinka‚Äôs hand. I‚Äôm sure Russ is a nice guy, but his game is completely broken. We cannot run from the pain. We must face the pain and come out the other side stronger. Give us all the hard teams right now.",0.86

629,2022-10-25 14:28:07,yd675b,Trading the 2027 and/or 2029 picks unprotected would be strategic malpractice,TheMedianUser,"Personally I think it would be absolute strategic malpractice to trade either or both unprotected 1st round picks. 

It's quite possible that the Lakers are abjectly awful in 2027 and 2029 (much like 2013-14 to 2018-19) - these seasons will be post LeBron, post AD's prime, and there are absolutely no promising youth players whatsoever and no high first round picks to fill that void. So trading those picks for players like Poeltl/Richardson or Turner/Hield is the absolute worst kind of short-termism BECAUSE both trades would completely empty the asset cupboard and neither trade creates a team that can actually contend for a championship.

The right move is to pull an Al Horford and send Westbrook home. He's still making his full salary but he's not playing and he's not on the bench and he's not in the locker room. If you can find some place to offload him without spending those 1st round picks then you do it OR taking on long-term salary, then you consider it. Otherwise, you let him roll off and then you use the cap space this offseason.

**TLDR: There is no trade that makes the Lakers a contender this year. So spending unprotected draft capital on average players is a fool's errand.**",0.66

People also need to understand his struggles. Sure we slander him for being the 2nd highest paid player in the leauge and not contributing enough, but it‚Äôs not like he does it willingly. He doesn‚Äôt have that explosiveness which i honestly think is normal, it‚Äôs going to be 15 years since his draft day next year. 

I think we as Lakers fans look this situation really one-sided. The man is under immense pressure and knows he is not wanted here. Even in press conferences people say confusing things about him. 

At least he tries to be good on defense, that‚Äôs a part of the game we can give him credit for. 

I believe there‚Äôs a deeper problem in this team and most of these problems stem from LeBron trying to be the GM and not WB bricking shots. Dont forget he brought him here in the first place. 

I honestly think watching those pre-LeBron 2018 young team and LeBron and the young guys at the start of 2019 was more fun than this team. We legit got 2 superstars and the product out there is so lackadysmal that it is embarassing. 

Either WB needs to get traded soon and we hope to bring out something from this ill-looking season or the guys in the locker room should just go and give him 100% support in front of everyone. There is no other solution

TLDR: LeBron brought him here and he is the one who traded everything away so go blame him a bit",0.24

I mean we are shooting badly but i can't imagine us shooting this badly for the rest of the season. Evem the nuggets were shooting horribly. 

Lebron played like trash today but we kept it close up until the end of the 3rd. Lebron shouldve played more aggressively starting the third. He was trying to get the team going and build up confidence but nobody was hitting shit.

Also the bounce passes to AD on the pick and roll arent working so he really should've stop giving them to AD cause he aint catching them.

Honestly the officiating continues to be trash. Definitely not blaming the loss on that but Lebron always gets slapped in the paint and no calls are given?! He had 2 drawn fouls the whole game while getting pushed ans slapped in the paint. I know he's a big guy and takes alot to move him but damn. How the hell do giannis, joel and jokic always ge tthe calls.

Lakers are about winning championships not 6th seeds. LeBron is about winning championships. Get him to the postseason, seeding doesn‚Äôt matter. It‚Äôs 0-0 when the series starts. 

There is no trade available right now that makes them contenders. That‚Äôs why they didn‚Äôt do the Indy deal. Fans need to be patient and remain optimistic. 

This roster was created to not have Russ on it. They‚Äôre competing hard defensively &amp; AD/Bron both look great. This team is only lacking 2 3 &amp; D wings (maybe a better C). 

I applaud Rob &amp; Jeanie for this offseason. LeBron is here for 2-3 years so is AD. The move they make needs to solidify the future. 

I‚Äôd rather be a play in with the right pieces than be a 6th seed with no future. They should‚Äôve beat the suns in 2021 had they stayed healthy. How hard is winning one game on the road when you have LeBron &amp; AD surrounded by the right pieces?

The reality is though that the Lakers window has shut. The league overall has gotten significantly better in the last couple years. There are more teams then ever that believe they have a chance at making the finals. 

The Lakers are in danger of making the same mistake with Lebron that they did with Kobe Bryant and that is to hang on to a team going nowhere and not acting in the franchises best interest. Hanging on with Kobe resulted in a lost decade for the Lakers. Doing the same with Lebron could be even worse.

Danny Ainge several years ago recognized the end of the era with Pierce and KG and made a move with the Nets that allowed them to activate a much faster rebuild and they got back into contention the East extremely quick. The vision for this franchise should be to blow it up and start fresh.

Moving AD this year would bring a ton of assets from one of the teams trying to contend. Lebron can break the scoring record this year and you can move him for more assets. 

The Lakers could acquire a boatload of picks between the two moves and have an almost entire clean cap.

Obviously our 19-20 chip team didn‚Äôt have elite shooting, but guys like KCP and Green would make you pay if you routinely sagged off them. I think we were like 20th or 21st in 3P as a team that season, but we had the guys to give us *enough* gravity in crunch time of big games. 

Just looking in the West alone at the Mavs, Warriors, Suns, Pels, Flippers, hell, even the Kings‚Ä¶they all got at least 5 or more players who can create gravity and hit jump shots. 


Realistically, we know many of our players are underperforming shot wise, and it‚Äôs not like the shot quality has been terrible either. So while it‚Äôs possible some guys will revert/ascend to their mean, even assuming that, we are still probably 2-3 shooters short of having any semblance of a coherent offense. That‚Äôs not to speak about a legit center to preserve AD‚Äôs fragile ass, but we are just so behind the curve in terms of anyone who can remotely create any gravity at all. 

All that said, if Rob is hypothetically able to get 2-3 spacers for Russ and 1 pick while packaging Nunn or Lonnie with another pick for a center, I guess that would kind of fix this roster? Maybe we‚Äôd be a wing stopper short still. 

What do you all think? The alternative is of course punt on this season but that would obviously suck having two seasons of a black hole in terms of not being an ass team.",0.9
826,2022-10-28 18:22:03,yfwlfz,We are in serious danger of becoming like the Knicks,william4534,"Y‚Äôall are really not gonna want to hear this, but it‚Äôs true. This isn‚Äôt just another ‚Äúwe suck and it‚Äôs Jeanie‚Äôs fault‚Äù posts, this is bigger than that. This is about the next decade plus of Lakers basketball.

We have a completely incompetent, money hungry owner who knows next to nothing about basketball, constantly banking on stars wanting to play here because of reputation and treating actual roster construction as an afterthought, cycling through coaches every other year to act like the front office isn‚Äôt the problem, etc.

If this keeps up much longer, we will be the Knicks of the west. Big market that fringe stars will flock to, but nobody actually looking to contend will so much as consider coming here. The only way to break this cycle is to completely and entirely gut the front office and ownership of the team, and when I say gut I mean GUT IT. The entire Buss family gone, the Rambi gone, Pelinka gone, and everyone with any ties to them gone. We cannot afford to have the slightest connection to those nepotistic dipshits because any connection is a foot in the door. This is serious.

It‚Äôs so damn hard to be loyal to a team that isn‚Äôt loyal to the fans, but if things don‚Äôt change it‚Äôs destined to stay that way for a long time.

Edit: alright since a bunch of you are having an aneurysm trying to comprehend the fact that our past success has next to no impact on our future, let me spell it out. I know we are WILDLY more successful than the Knicks, I get it, you don‚Äôt have to say ‚Äúwe won a ring two years ago‚Äù over and over again. What I‚Äôm saying is that going forward, our front office is incompetent enough that, if ownership doesn‚Äôt change, we could seriously be looking at a 15-20 year stretch just like the Knicks have had. In 2040 we could be the team that has the reputation of ‚Äúbig name, big city, haven‚Äôt won shit in decades‚Äù.",0.76

1) Old age is finally catching up to Bron in a way that I think 'this is it'. He's getting decent numbers but the impact isn't there. Peak LeBron would be able to carry this team on his back. I'm not seeing a scenario here where the LeBron is a top 10 player in the league and if he isn't that, the Lakers have no one capable of leading them to a title.

2) AD has not taken his game to the next level. From 6 ft to the 3P line, he's shooting 15%. He doesn't get to the FT line because he's afraid of contact. He's shooting 18% from three. Other than easy baskets under the rim, AD has not been a reliable offensive option.

3) Westbrook... we don't need to rehash this.

4) Patrick Beverley has been ALL TALK, NO ACTION. Blanking wide open threes, making silly fouls, borderline unplayable at times.

5) Who on this team can step up? No one. Lonnie has looked good but he can't shoot the ball.. 18% from three but he's the Lakers second best option. Other than Austin Reaves and Matt Ryan (both take a few threes per game) shooting, the next best shooter is LeBron at 26%. Kendrick Nunn has been an utter disappointment. Troy Brown can't do anything offensively. Juan Toscano, zip. NO ONE on this team can contribute.

6) Unless the Lakers get a superstar player and round up the roster with some good shooters, there is no point in wasting picks. As it is, this roster is not a title contending team, period. Anyone thinking it will somehow magically get better is delusional. The only improvement I'm seeing is defense. Other than that, the offense is historically atrocious. 

IMO, this Lakers squad should HIGHLY consider trading BOTH LeBron and AD. Keep Westbrook and tank for Wembanyama. That is the ONLY solution I see. Why? We've been saying it for quite some time now but AD is not a SUPERSTAR CHAMPIONSHIP talent who can lead your franchise. Keep his name out of Doncic, Jokic, Giannis, etc., category. He can't carry a team. IDC what anyone says. Bron is too old. Let this guy compete for a title on a team that actually has a chance. Get some picks, younger talent, and rebuild. There is no other way. Lakers are not winning with this roster, period. And Hield/Turner won't change much because the rest of the guys on this team are not contributing.",0.48

I remember saying that we run the risk of punting the season entirely by trying to wait on a trade in the idiotic hope that it would increase our leverage. The only way our leverage would increase by the deadline is if we remain high enough in the standings (8th seed-ish).

Yes, I am a LeBron fan and that is why I root for the Lakers. But I am sick and tired of our sub and our ‚ÄúLaker‚Äù fans. So many of you guys are reactive and not proactive. I warned you guys about Jeanie so many times and people are finally starting to get the message. The worst part about rooting for the Lakers has been how many ‚Äúfans‚Äù have been looking to blame Bron at any chance they get when realistically he should be the last person to blame.

Age 38 season, still our best player. Brought us ring 17 and would have won in 2021 as well had AD not gotten injured against the Suns. Bron and even AD are the last 2 people to blame in this situation. 

Bron wanted Ty Lue, wanted Dudley to stay as a coach, wanted Caruso. How come our FO was able to say ‚ÄúNo‚Äù then? In fact, he even wanted Demar over WestBrick but Jeanie didn‚Äôt want to commit to Demar‚Äôs 3yr contract. So why in the world are we not directing all of the blame towards Jeanie and the FO? The Russ trade is on them. Not only could they have had Demar instead, they also said ‚ÄúNo‚Äù to LeBron many other times before, why couldn‚Äôt they say no again in the supposed buildup to the WestBrick trade? 

Whether the Lakers luck into success, maximizing winning still requires not only a FO overhaul, but Jeanie/Buss family selling their majority stake of the team to richer ownership. They can arrange for a smaller minority ownership if they so please. I knew we were headed for a punted season months ago and I can‚Äôt believe how many of you gave our FO the benefit of doubt as they are continuing to take half-measures.",0.55

913,2022-10-29 15:51:13,ygn2yn,5 games in and we already know what we are.,poptony3,"These 5 games along with the pre-season already show what this team is and will be if no changes are made. 

1. This roster is poorly constructed, there‚Äôs no way around it. Everybody and their mother knows that the formula for a good Lebron team is Lebron + shooters.
Knowing that Rob opted for our FAs instead of Brynn Forbes, OPJ, Bruce Brown etc. Now we are shooting 25% on 3PTS, and I don‚Äôt see no one on our rooster making it better. 

2. Russ is a bad fit, we all know that, there‚Äôs no way around it he‚Äôs just a bad fit. Dude needs the ball too much, is a poor shooter, bad decision maker, has prob the worst hands for a point guard (thank you skip), bad defender, bad free throw shooter. I can go on and on.

3. Our offense has no identity, there‚Äôs no flow, we are too reliant on Lebron, and AD is not as involved specially in the 4th as he should be. We have no consistent shoot creators or shoot makers, to make the offense work.

4. Bev and Lonnie are better coming off the bench. Actually if we had serviceable starters, we would have a strong bench with them 2 coming off the bench, instead of playing &gt; 30 mins per game.

5. Brown Jr and Reaves are playing good. I‚Äôve been impressed with Brown Jr defense, and how he fits with the started. Nonetheless, they are not starting caliber players, at least at this moment, but can be 3&amp;D guys for us. 

6. Ham has not impressed me with the offense but our defense has been great. We have been in games despite our shooting and all the things mentioned above. It‚Äôs exciting because we can actually build on our defense as the season goes on. 

7. This team won‚Äôt make the playoffs as constructed. The Indiana trade can put us really close to actual contention. Myles at the 5 and AD at the 4 can make up for Buddy being a turnstile, and the offense would improve greatly. However, that deals leaves us with no assets and we would still have a hole in the 3&amp;D department as we only have Troy Brown JR and he‚Äôs not a consistent shooter. The San Antonio deal gives us more flexibility but since we can even move Poelt for a good return, but I highly doubt that Pop will do business with us.

8. The bottom line is that we can all speculate, hypothesize and fantasize about deals but at the end is our FO who has to make a decision and I really have 0 trust in them. We all should just try to see the positives and see how a year of Lebron and AD gets thrown away by probably the worst FO in sports. Trust me this travesty will be taught at GM and FO clases in the future.

Ultimately I don't care how great you are at finding undervalued players relying this much on minimum players will get you nowhere as a team

920,2022-10-29 18:09:14,ygqjnp,"Every day the Lakers are not trading the two future picks, they are destroying their own future.",JesusDaBeast,"**TLDR: The Lakers build their team not through the draft, thus the picks have not as much value as one would think. But the incompetence from FO and ownership could effect their pull on FA/trading in the future, which would be detrimental to the Lakers process in building future teams.**

You have Lebron fucking James on your squad. Arguable face of the league and greatest player to ever grace the sport. He is in the dwindling years along with AD. The team is the Los Angeles Lakers, 17 time champions. Just off of that alone you should go all in to try to do whatever you can to be good. This shit is unacceptable given the Lakers history.

But aside from that consider this: the team doesn‚Äôt really build from the draft, rather constructing their squads through trade/FA. For any willing stars that want out, LA is usually a top destination. What difference will two picks be if they can acquire another star in the future to keep the team competitive?

The issue with that thinking is assuming anyone would want to go to LA now. Every day the Lakers look more incompetent, which doesn‚Äôt exactly give any confidence to upcoming free agents to join your team. You can only pitch good weather and brand opportunities to prospects for so long‚Ä¶ especially when there‚Äôs another team who can do that (with a better FO and ownership as well).

In the era of player empowerment, they notice who is well run and who is not. It‚Äôs why the Knicks have suffered for so long. And if the Lakers keep it up, they‚Äôll suffer too.

Will say the Indiana or San Antonio trade make them contenders? No. But it will make them a playoff team, and more importantly it will IMPROVE the squad. Which as a star player (like Lebron) is all you can ask from your FO, improving the team while you‚Äôre there.

Starters: Bev, Troy Brown, LeBron, AD, Wenyen

Rationale: Wenyen actually is not total hot garbage as a big and really did a good job fighting Minnesota‚Äôs bigs in terms of defending lob threats and dump off passes. Troy Brown‚Äôs shot isn‚Äôt totally broken, and Bev is primarily there to harass the other team at the point of attack. 

The Russ bench youth movement looked promising against the Wolves, letting him just run and gun and create offense for cutters like Reaves and JTA looked not terrible. It‚Äôs a shame Thomas Bryant doesn‚Äôt seem like he will be the stretch big option we hoped for, since he would naturally play well with Russ in terms of providing him more space to operate.

2) Pelinka is disliked by several sports agencies. The only sports agency that works with Pelinka regularly is Klutch Sports and even they don‚Äôt do Pelinka any favors. Rich Paul uses Pelinka to get his guys contracts (ex. Massive overpay for THT). Rumors are that CAA has blacklisted Rob Pelinka

- this years roster has 6 Klutch Clients, last years team had more than that 


Lakers fans should be worried about the Lakers future. Once Lebron leaves or retires, Klutch may also abandon Pelinka!!


The real reason Pelinka should  be fired is bc of his horrible reputation


HEADS up: I looked at Klutch Sports Clients List and they barley have any 3-pt shooters signed. All the good 3-pt shooters or centers are represented by different agencies (Excel, CAA, ect‚Ä¶)",0.74

The truth of the matter is that with AD and Lebron the strategy is to allocate max money across a few role players that provide complementary skill sets.

People will defend the FO for winning in 2020 but they accidentally assembled that roster, with the initial goal being to hunt for Kawhi. They then reverted to their out dated strategies with the Westbrook deal and here we are.

Had they made the Indiana deal prior to the season, our outlook would be dramatically different. But they didn‚Äôt and they won‚Äôt. FO‚Äôs around the league must have crazy group chats - imagine you gave Lebron and AD to any other FO?

This org is doomed until the FO changes and Bron and AD cannot beat Jeanie and Rob.",0.89

1074,2022-11-01 00:36:29,yitvym,How Come The Lakers Couldn‚Äôt Get In On A Three Team Trade That Sent James Harden To The Nets?,OhMyMe17,"One of the most pivotal players given up by the Nets in this deal, seemingly for no reason, was Jarrett Allen. Who even before the trade, was ideal for the Nets or most other teams in need of a strong defensive anchor Center. Because in that three team deal, this is all the Cavs had to give up, to acquire Jarrett Allen.

Cavs trade: G Dante Exum &amp; 2022 first-round pick (via Milwaukee) to Houston | 2024 second-round pick to Brooklyn.

Back when this deal happened in January 2021, Lakers couldn‚Äôt have traded their 2021 first rounder (which was later traded for Westbrook anyway) and a future 2nd rounder to make this happen? And Dante Exum was just salary filler since he had no value as a player.

Just a shame because an AD and Allen frontcourt would have been suffocating for opposing offenses.",0.38

1147,2022-11-02 22:35:13,ykk2sj,"Assuming Lakers don't want to give up picks in the trades and are looking for the 2023 free agency to improve the roster, they would be having around 30 million in cap space. Thats simply not enough to improve the roster to a championship calibre roster imo.",TheWhisperingDeath,"Firstly, the free agency class ain't that great. The truly top tier free agents like Harden, Kyrie, Middleton and FVV will all cost more than 30 odd million. Kyrie possibly may take a pay cut because no one would want to touch him with a barge pole.

Lakers can have the likes of Draymond, Porzingis, Turner, Poeltl, Grant and Kuzma etc but they will take up majority of the 30 odd million and Lakers will be left with very little then to improve the roster afterwards.

Also, if Lakers decide to go down that path, they will end up losing salary cap fillers like Russ and Pat Bev for nothing. They will once again be in the same situation they were sometime back where they don't have enough contracts to move around to get a player even from a trade later down the line.

I think right now is Lakers' best opportunity to improve the roster if they really want to compete for the Championship in the next couple of years. Because you have expiring contracts who you can pair up with the picks and get players back in return and then hopefully secure them long term. Guys like Rozier + Oubre + Hayward or Turner + Buddy are going to be better than any combination of players Lakers will be able to get in the free agency in all likelihood.",0.74

I have been especially impressed by his defense so far. Spurs fans and advanced stats nerds were saying that he was horrid on that end, so I was really concerned about it. However, it really looks like he put in the work on that end this past summer. 

Offensively, after struggling a little bit at first, he‚Äôs starting to find his stride, as of late, carrying us on several occasions when we‚Äôve need it.

We were the only team in discussion for him, and that smoke lasted long enough there was a time where it felt a deal could've landed.

If, and when this happens, I actually think we'll contend. I'm not denying Kyrie is the biggest muppet in sports, but with Bron they'll be able to do it. The option to move Russ for a big and a shooter (Turner and Hield) and we've created a team with tremendous depth.

There's so many if's in the scenario but the only far-fetched part is Irving not losing his damn mind, something he's done time and time again over the last 6 or so years. The last time he wasn't acknowledged as a complete nut job, he shared a locker room with LeBron.

It's optimistic, but I can't deny the promising thoughts of it all.",1.0

- Julius Randle is putting up crap stats with a horrible contract and the Knicks aren‚Äôt going anywhere 

- Lonzo seems like his career might be over. Zero timetable for his return. Could you imagine the fiasco if he was still
with the Lakers

- Ingram is a nice player, but he isn‚Äôt close to the guy that SGA is. The Clippers traded an All-NBA player and like 7 picks for Paul George who shit the bed in the 2020 playoffs and the proceeded to miss a year with injury

On top of all of this, Kawhi seems like he‚Äôll never play 10 straight games ever again. All I‚Äôm gonna say is that things could have been so much worse and we should be grateful for what we‚Äôve gotten as fans.

Lebron‚Äôs current stats: 25.0 /9.0 / 7.4 on 43.9% fg%. His shooting and layups have been off, he‚Äôs looked sluggish at times. After this most recent game it came out that he has been battling some sort of flu-like illness. 

I know father time is undefeated, but this same man averaged over 30ppg last year on elite efficiency, dropped 56 against the warriors. I think he is capable of FAR better performances in the future. I think within the next 10-20 games, we will see Lebron return to close to 50% fg. If I were to bet, there will be a couple games he completely takes over. 

Calling it now, he will drop a 40 piece within a month or 2. I think it will also galvanize the team",1.0

1373,2022-11-04 17:02:34,ym4b11,Which route would you prefer we go?,playmiker,"It's been an interesting start to the year so far. One thing that's clear though, as Trevor Lane keeps saying, this roster is screaming for a trade. All summer long we were begging for a Russ trade. Now we're seeing Benchbrook might be the way to go forward. Regardless, we will need to make a move at some point in order to fully unlock this lineup. The question is, how big of a trade do we do?

1. The big one. Trade Westbrook for any of the available packages that we're all aware of now (Pacers, Hornets, etc).

2. Mid level. Use Pat Bev's contract (and Nunn if you need it) to help solve one of our needs. Potential targets here - Myles Turner or Buddy Hield, Poeltl + Josh Richardson, Jae Crowder.

3. A smaller deal. We can use Nunn's contract plus a minimum (or Damian Jones since he makes a little more than a minimum) to try to also try to solve one of our needs. Potential targets here - Poeltl, Seth Curry, Cam Reddish, Justin Holiday

What route would you prefer? Any potential targets I missed? Personally I think we should wait the 20 or so games that they're planning to wait in order to see if Benchbrook keeps it up, guys like Jones/Nunn figure it out, how Bryant looks when he's back, etc. But for me, best case scenario is Benchbrook keeps this up, PatBev figures out his shooting to go along with the defense/leadership he brings and you're able to do #3 and bring in an upgrade to our shooting or size on a smaller deal.",1.0

They became 2017 warriors against this good defensive team.
Plus they just blew nuggets and other contenders too so lol they are not tanking this year.
Russ was AMAZING. Like I was questioning ab Darvin Ham how he didnt let Russ take game over till the 4th.

Lonnie Walker also performs better than I would have expected , Pat Bev is Pat Bev (even if his stats are worse) and Reaves is Reaves. I dont think we will take minutes away from WB , so whats gonna happen? 

I hope Dennis will perform good aswell, so maybe LeBron doesnt have to look to score as much as he is doing rightnow. He can then find his rhythm again to shoot better and i wouldnt mind him going to a 20/22 ppg and 10apg guy with AD being the first option on offense.",1.0

He was awful last season and looked awful at the start of this season. No one maligned him unfairly by saying that. I do have to say that he's been absolutely great since moving to the bench. It's unfortunate that somehow LeBron forgot how to play basketball during this stretch but it gives me hope that when Bron recovers his form, along with Benchbrook, and ADPOY, this team will present a lot of issues in the NBA. Lonnie and Troy look really solid too. I love the contrasting style of play between Bron and Russ, makes them much harder to plan against. I choose to see the glass, as half full.

1454,2022-11-05 15:45:39,ymxmyv,[OC] We might be witnessing the start of LeDecline,regnard,"10% of the season is already done and I was looking for early trends with the Lakers. One thing has been mentioned was the poor play of LeBron (due to health reasons) and a few metrics jumped right out at me.

This season is LeBron‚Äôs slowest start since his rookie year as [per advanced metrics](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/jamesle01.html):

- PER
- True Shooting %
- Box Plus-Minus (BPM)

A quick primer on these metrics: PER looks at over all play and efficiency, BPM looks at impact in the game, TS is a broad shooting metric.

What the these numbers suggest is that LeBron is struggling offensively and has not contributed much positively when he‚Äôs on the floor. His abysmal shooting has sunk his efficiency metrics.

Watching the Lakers games confirms the eye test for LeBron‚Äôs struggles:

- His 3 point shooting has been far laser-like (lowest 3pt% in career)
- Multiple missed layups (3rd lowest fg% of shots near the basket)
- Let‚Äôs not get into defense that much but LeBron is matching his career-high foul rate.

So what does this mean to the Lakers?

LeBron is solid but is far from Legendary All-NBA form with this slow start. That could contribute to more losses than wins. The team could be 5-11 just after Thanksgiving.

1456,2022-11-05 16:32:23,ymywoj,Is Lebron declining?,panashechd,"No, he isn‚Äôt. After watching LBJ for the past 4-5 years, it‚Äôs clear that Lebron has been passive these last few games. I don‚Äôt know whether he‚Äôs injured or sick but sometimes it looks like he isn‚Äôt all there. He was matched on Lauri several times and didn‚Äôt drive once, that was a huge red flag to me especially since Lauri isn‚Äôt a good defender.

I think people are jumping to conclusions, I remember when we had these same ‚ÄúFather Time‚Äù conversations during the end of the 21‚Äô season. 22‚Äô season he averaged 30 and we were back on the ‚ÄúLebron is perfectly fine‚Äù train. Few months later, he‚Äôs dealing with a sickness and injuries and now he‚Äôs declined again. I‚Äôd expect this from other fanbase but it‚Äôs disappointing from Laker nation. 

I‚Äôm curious to see how the perception on Lebron and Russ will change in the upcoming weeks. Realistically, Russ won‚Äôt average amazing numbers on good efficiency forever, that‚Äôs never been Westbrook. NBA players have great stretches all the time, the same way NBA players have slumps all the time.  

Maybe I‚Äôm wrong, but Russ‚Äô career shows that he goes on these runs occasionally but eventually it wears off. The same way LBJ‚Äôs career shows that he starts each season pretty rough but usually goes back to normal come January, around all star break. So yeah I‚Äôm curious to see how the narrative will switch when we hit that mark in the season.",1.0

We've got enough guard depth (Walker, Russ, Reaves, Schroder with Christie for garbage)

We've got enough SF depth (Brown, JTA, Ryan)

We have almost no PF depth (LBJ, Gabriel)

and almost no C depth (AD, Gabriel at times)

The following are just not that important for us considering our gaping holes at PF/C:

Bev - defensively elite but we'd be a better overall team if we had a PF or C here.

Nunn - decent, slumping but we've got 4 other guards better than him right now, 5 including Bev

Jones - just not that good

Bryant - i'd keep him just cuz he's cheap and has some upside.

So what's the best return we could get for Bev/Nunn + draft assets that provides a better big wing or a center. We REALLY need something better than just Gabriel effectively backing up both positions.",1.0

This is now 4 consecutive games where he‚Äôs been not just good but exceptional off the bench, and even though it‚Äôs a small sample size, keep in mind that it is 100% of his bench games so far. It‚Äôs not like we‚Äôre cherrypicking 4 out of 30 games off the bench, we are simply seeing the result of a new role. 

I get it, 47 million and all that, so say we trade him, then what. Are we not going to acknowledge that he is filling a role I don‚Äôt see anyone else possibly filling? We‚Äôve been talking ad nauseam about getting LeBron another playmaker so he doesn‚Äôt have to carry as big a load on offence allowing him to lock in more on D, and Russ is doing that better than anyone we could possibly trade for. Every single person we are considering trading for is either a play finisher, or can only create offence for them self, meanwhile Russ can do both while also creating for everyone else. 

He‚Äôs also a defensive cheat code if he keeps up the way he‚Äôs been playing on that end. 6‚Äô3‚Äù but VERY strong and VERY quick, allowing him to guard point guards while also being able to survive a mismatch until another switch can be found.

Not to mention he is known to be an iron man, and will likely play 75+ games, which is huge on a team with such rough depth.",1.0

1482,2022-11-06 01:21:27,ynctlb,"Went to last night's Jazz vs Lakers game, here are my observations and insights",Inevitable_Night_933,"- 5 Lakers warmed up pre-game when fans were allowed in. JTA, Austin, Beverly, Brown, and Wenyen. By comparison, I think I saw 8-9 Jazz players shooting the ball pregame including every single starter on the team.

- A few Jazz players were sucking up to the refs pregame, particularly Mike Conley. Did not seem to help much they called a fair game.

-  Darvin has a great energy to him. Every time a Jazz player hit a 3 he had a huge reaction of disappointment, almost like a fan, was endearing to see.

- There is something going on with this team chemistry wise, and not in a good way. When the team was down 14, Russell was laughing and joking with Dennis the entire time meanwhile LeBron looked pissed. I think Russ is just happy to get his stats and knows he's getting traded soon. 

- Russ was in a fantastic mood all night but did not acknowledge the crowd whatsoever despite lots of cheering for him in between moments. It was an odd contrast given the score of the game. 

- Russ talked with AD a bunch and Bev at times, but I did not see Russ and LeBron acknowledge once at all on the bench or anytime the game was not going on. Was very odd. The body language from the team seemed off the entire night too, even when the game got closer.

- Bev was not his usual self and looked hesitant at shooting the 3. He looked awful at shootaround and was not even making easy mid-range jumpers, I think he made one three when I was watching out of 7-8. Austin Reaves and Wenyen by comparison hit 3's consistently at shootaround.

- The coaching staff was mostly critical of people's defensive efforts getting on Russ and Walker the most from what I saw on fouls or timeouts. Darvin many times wanted the pace to be faster than what they were doing on defensive rebounds.

any other questions let me know! I was most surprised by the Bron/Russ dynamic which you didn't necessarily get just watching it on TV",1.0

Clearly they‚Äôve forgotten how comical it is that his so-called ‚ÄúBenchbrook‚Äú performance is absolutely horrible for a player wasting $47m of our cap space while still being given starter-like minutes because Ham feels the need to cater to his hurt feelings and ego.

Evidently it‚Äôs even affecting LeBron‚Äôs performance because he needs to play alongside this brick-piler who not only can‚Äôt spread the floor but continues his cringy on-court antics like baby-cradling after every easy open layup or hilariously over-dribbling and dancing around the ball only to end up throwing a wild pass out of bounds and costing the team a crucial turnover.

i think most of you know the threesome mentioned in the title. (If not, shame on you) 

With Darius now officially joining the Lakers, it means all three of them are employed by our beloved franchise. 

Darius' independency made him the most critical and unbiased of the three.  While I love Petes passion and his genuine Lakers fandom, you could see how being a Lakers employee made him more cautios with what he says on the pod. 

I like Mike as well, but not being a fan at first and working for the Lakers for over a decade led to him being pretty conservative and cautios with his opinions and takes. 

I love the LFR pod, but with all three of them now representing the P&amp;G in some form I wonder how honest and critical the pod can be in the future. 

Especially Darius was known for being pretty honest about certain things that went wrong within the organisation. 

I can still recommend the LFR pod for your daily dose of Lakers coverage.

Troy brown jr is trash. He shot way way to many shots in the 4th. Like there was a span of like 5 straight possesion were he just shot a few jumpers. He's also trash on defense.


Lonnie walker is way too inconsistent. Like he's getting good looks but isn't consistent with them. Also trash on defense.


Nunn is trash.


Westbrook started off hot in the first half making like  three 3s in a row but obviously wasnt sustainable. He was kinda of bad in the second half and some turnovers were costly.


Reaves is scared of shooting the ball. Like everytime russ or bron draw the defense in and lob it out to reeves, he pump fakes when the defender is like 2 meters away and just passes it in the end. He should really have some balls to take the shots.


Matt ryan was good as drawing defenses out of the box but he did get to shoot cause he couldnt get open.


I like gabriel. He's a good hustler but cant shoot so using him for 10-15 mins is fine.


LeBron was good today. He's still in his head cause he isnt making his normal shots and isnt hitting his 3s but its a good comeback game from him.


I'm not sure what to say about AD. He was good but something seemed off. Maybe its because they were playing zone and packed the paint so he couldnt get hus shots or lobs from LeBron and russ. But he really should stop shooting those iso's. They aint gonna fall.


As good as russ has been for us, we really should trade him for some pieces. We really need good rim protectors/ rebounders and 3 pt shooting. For example if we did the pacers deal, a lineup of:

LBJ, Buddy, matt ryan, AD, Turner.

Matt ryan, buddy, turner provide good spacing for LBJ and AD. LBJ, AD and Turner would cover somewhat for buddy and matt on defense.",0.71

They have been hustling on the defensive end. There have been lapses but the effort on the defensive end has been good and something to be encouraged with. 

The offense though has been quite bad. Especially in the half court. They obviously need the shooting but they also need someone who can also shoot off the dribble as well. LeBron used to do that but his jumper has been broken this season and even then he really is the only one who can do that. You need at least a couple of them in modern NBA. Its the case with almost every good team. There are often possessions where Lakers would look for openings to attack the paint but due to good defense, they would end up going nowhere and have someone take a off balanced bad bricked shot which more often than not ends up being a good chance for the opposition to get an easy bucket in transition. So, having a guy who can bail out with those shots would help the defense out as well because they can somewhat rest a bit and not rush back to stop transition almost every other possession.

I don't know what Rob and co are planning or have planned but I still feel there's a lot to be encouraged with than discouraged about.",1.0

Reasons were simple: his position is crowded, only his contract is somewhat tradeable and Lakers desperately needs wing depth.

Some r/lakers members were calling me out and they were sharing their enthusiastic opinions about Nunn who didn't played meaning minutes for more than a year. Also we shouldn't forget that he wasn't that good in his last season with the Heat. Let's see some comments to logical suggestion.

&gt; Watch what Nunn does this season. You‚Äôll exclude him from your future ‚Äútrade proposals‚Äù.

&gt; Why is everyone so inclined to dump Nunn in trades? He‚Äôs going to be a really good player for us if he plays like his Miami self

&gt; Fuck that. If Nunn is healthy he‚Äôs better than Crowder and the Pacers deal isn‚Äôt worth 2 firsts.

&gt; Why's everyone so sure Myles Turner and Buddy Hield would solve all our problems. Turner isn't nearly as good as people make him out to be. On top of that he's injury prone. Hield is basically slightly better Heat Nunn. 

&gt; We don‚Äôt need potential we need immediate contribution, Nunn gives us that and Reddish doesn‚Äôt

&gt; Nunn is being hyper underrated. Dude put up 2+ win shares in playoff basketball and is our second best shooter and, at this point, best off ball scorer in the backcourt. A Shroeder/Nunn/Bev/Reaves/Walker backcourt is really cool.

&gt; I wouldn‚Äôt trade Nunn unless it was in a trade bringing back much better talent

&gt; Nunn is solid man. He can provide scoring when the offense is stagnant.

With that being said those lows were expected, retirement of Kobe and the lack of talent around him and injured we knew tough times would be ahead. Yet even when Magic retired unexpectedly a lot of uncertainty, but Dr. Buss didn‚Äôt fold he kept on turning and finding talent to keep them competitive.

I will forever be thankful for the greatest sports owner to ever live he cared so much for its fans for the entertainment of it, the competitiveness of showing his product on the floor and producing in my lifetime 10
championships. But unlike him his children, have become and absolute laughing stock, have taken this franchise to levels i would never ever imagine the Los Angeles Lakers would become, a dumpster fire.

Jeanie Buss came in blazing hot taking the power of his brother which in his own right was a dumpster fire himself, she wanted to talk the talk but only came in and stumble walking getting her ankles broken left and right.

Her mistakes in my eyes would be solved as she gained more experience, boy was i wrong!. She has made those mistakes bigger, more miserable and frustrating to the fans and players. She allowed to many cooks in the kitchen, from Magic, Phil Jackson, The Rambi(uuuuuughhh!!!) and Pelinka. She has lost absolute control of the franchise, she will do her own PR rounds to suck up to the fans to distract from the incompetence she has employed.

Her massive mistake was the hiring of Pelinka, with her having and absolute loyalty to the late Kobe, she hires Pelinka who in the NBA circles was known as an absolute asshole to negotiate a person who people disliked to negotiate because of his abuse of power, and now the lakers are paying for it big time, since he has been here we have made in my opinion horrible trades and acquisitions that have put the worst product on the court, between him and Jeanie they dissolved a championship team for a bunch of old or bench players in the last two years. Not even Cleveland could build a team this horrible around LeBron. It‚Äôs just painful to see that another franchise player has fallen hard in the hands of Jeanie Buss.

As much as i would like to think when hard times came and Dr. Buss was here he had the confidence that he would show how to solve this problem immediately, i can‚Äôt say with 100% confidence that Jeanie and Pelinka will fix this and Bron will get his fifth chip with us. I don‚Äôt know how many of you felt when Bron signed an extension i personally felt confused as to why he would do it and only Bron knows why. But the extension to Pelinka was by far a massive L, he hasn‚Äôt shown the ability to be a GM, he has been MIA in trade deadlines and in answering tough questions on roster decisions. Not even Kupchak was this bad, he did made some questionable decisions but teams at least would talk to him and negotiate i can‚Äôt say the same thing is happening with Rob ‚ÄúLowe‚Äù Pelinka.

So where do we go from here, i have read a lot of fans asking the Buss family to sell the team, and i have to agree, the lakers nepotism is on an absolute high, this team needs people who are not in any way related to the lakers, and let them help the team and inject some trust that they will be successful.

Sorry for the long vent and frustration, a band aid to this organization won‚Äôt fix future problems but ripping the band aid off and actually healing and learning from mistakes will actually make this franchise healthy again.

I hope many of you have a healthy avenue to vent, i have live the Lakers since i saw Magic so his first no look pass and never looked back i can only hope times like that will come soon.

1561,2022-11-07 03:25:31,yobe64,To people wondering what happened,SgameB,"The minimum contract guys started playing like their contracts. Inconsistency is the reason those guys were available for a minimum or a TPMLE. It doesn't mean that they are not talented or don't put in the necessary work, they just lack consistency and that possession by possession desire to compete. In some games, they will play like starters ‚Äì locked in defensively, aggressive, and making shots ‚Äì leading their fans to think that they got some 15M guys for a steal. In other games, they will show up, perhaps, for a quarter and then disappear. After stacking a few losses and hurting their pride, those players will muster up enough motivation to again put together a full 48 min game and maybe even string a few wins together. However, they will become complaisant before long.

Now that is a very normal human behavior, it doesn't mean they are bad players, in fact, they have the skills and they are still getting paid millions, but you can't expect them to compete in every single game and every single possession. In most jobs, people can afford to get a little lax as they can pick up the slack later and still do really well, but not in competitive sports. They are competing at the highest level against the best in the world, that desire to compete every single day is precisely what separates minimum guys from 15M guys from max players, that's what separates mediocre teams from contenders from a championship team. 

Unless Darvin Ham can change who those minimum guys inherently are, expect a rollercoaster ride of a season. And I don't think you can in a few month change who they are, change their mindset, and change what makes them tick. If the prospect of getting a 60Million dollar contract didn't motivate them after their rookie contract, I don't think a stick from Darvin can do much either; they are not 20-year-old teenagers, they are who they are, inconsistent minimum guys.",1.0

People are saying that because so much salary is tied up in the big-3 or because of how little value the team is getting on Westbrook, it's impossible for them to be competitive.  I've noticed a lot of people say that because of this, a trade is necessary.

This is wrong.

It's also not only wrong to blame Jeanie or Pelinka for this, but downright stupid and toxic.

In order to understand this, you only need to take a quick look at the 2019-2020 roster and the 2022-2023 roster and compare their salaries.

NBA 2019-2020 Salary Cap: $109,140,000

14 | Kyle Kuzma | $2m** | 1.8%**
15 | Talen Horton-Tucker | $0.9m** | 0.8%**

This was the final payroll of the 2019-2020 roster with some small exclusions like Dion Waiters, JR Smith, and 2-way contracts.

NBA 2022-2023 Salary Cap: $123,655,000

*Even if these salaries differ, they are all minimum salary exceptions and the higher cost ones fall under veteran minimum exception clauses.

**These are rookie-scale contracts.

In a 1 to 1 comparison, outside of this current roster just being more expensive, it's important to look at each roster spot in specific.  As you can see, compared to the 2019-2020 team, this current roster is paying more or comparable amounts to the players at nearly every roster spot.  This has nothing to do with the increasing salaries of the NBA as the % of the cap normalizes for that.  Yes, the team is paying a huge amount of money for Westbrook, but the equivalent top 3 salary on that 2019-2020 team aside from LeBron and AD was Danny Green at $14.6m.  Moving down from there, Patrick Beverley is paid more than KCP was in relative value.  Walker IV is paid more than Bradley in relative value.  Nunn was paid more than McGee in relative value.  Etc.

The problem with this roster is not the salary distribution.  They proved in 2019-2020 that they could win with a cheaper overall salary distribution.  The problems are elsewhere --

1. LeBron James and AD are occupying relatively similar amounts of the cap but are no longer the players they were in the 2019-2020 season.  With LeBron, it's excusable.  With AD, it's not.  Because of their decline, more is needed from the rest of the team.  On that point, if this was the 2019-2020 roster, they would be even worse equipped to deal with 2022-2023 LeBron and AD.  So, stop saying that team was better constructed from a salary:depth perspective.  It was not.  People have his misconception that the way the two teams are built are different when they're not.  The 2019-2020 team was not big-2 + role-players anymore than it is now.

2. The 2019-2020 roster had some big steals relative to their cap%.  Dwight Howard, playoff Rondo, Markieff Morris, Kyle Kuzma and Alex Caruso all played well above their value.  For Kuzma and Caruso, you could credit the team.  With Howard, Rondo, and Morris, there was an element of chance.  From the current 2022-2023 roster, only Walker IV, Troy Brown Jr., and Austin Reaves are currently playing above their value to comparable degrees.

3. A number of current players are playing well below their value.  While Westbrook is playing well beneath his contract value of $47.1m and that's a major issue, similarly bad is the rest of the roster.  Patrick Beverley and Kendrick Nunn are performing well below their 19-20 counterparts in terms of cost:productivity.  Schroder and Bryant have been injured.  Jones has been a dud.

I think he also did a shoulder-shimmy thing too? Again, all these antics for a fat juicy ""L"" on our record to close the night.

Why does he always steal rebounds away from our big-men? Like [this](https://youtu.be/5A9WY7nSaZk?t=39). I've seen it happen so many times where nobody from the other team is under the basket but he literally steals the rebound away by tapping the ball to himself and AD is like wtf... Gotta stat-pad even when benched?

And why is Ham so retarded that he benches Brick but still plays him 30+ min each game (which is basically the same as starting and kills our team) and keeps him in to close games?  He should only be given like 12-16min in short 3-4min bursts, if any; just enough to push the tempo with the second unit and keep us going, but not enough for him to become a comical clown with his stupid on-court antics and out-of-control wtf bricks/turnovers, especially in the 4th quarter.

Trashbrick is literally one of the worst, most unpleasant bums to watch in the NBA in recent years and hearing those delusional fanboy ""MVP"" chants has been so cringey smh.",0.5

Went to 16 NBA Finals and Won 10...,EnergyFax,"In his 34 years as owner of the Lakers, his teams went to the NBA Finals a ridiculous 16 times and won 10 NBA championships. Under Buss the lakers missed the playoffs ONLY TWO TIMES!

Since his death the lakers have missed the playoffs 7 times in the span of 9 Years.

Dr. Jerry Buss ran his organization through a simple formula: hire the best, most talented people and get the hell out of their way.

Bringing in legendary basketball minds, such as Bill Sharman, Jerry West, Phil Jackson and Mitch Kupchak, and bestowing them with all the authority necessary to make decisions has been Buss' key to successful management over the past three and half decades.

His trust fund baby kids run the lakers like some sick nepotism work shop, something you would see from a horror comedy. His kids grew up welthy and privileged and know nothing about hard work and pride.

The lack of humility before nature that's being displayed here, uh... staggers me. With his kids taking over I thought things would be bit different but nothing I had to fear... But they ended up being a lot worse. Don't you see the danger here guys inherent in what They're doing? Ownership power is the most awesome force the planet's ever seen, but they have been wielding it like a kid that's found his dad's gun. If I may... Um, I'll tell you the problem with the ownership power that they're using here, it didn't require any discipline to attain it. They were gifted the team through there fathers death with no discipline to attain it. They didn't earn the knowledge for themselves, so they don't take any responsibility for it. They stood on the shoulders of legends to accomplish something as fast as they could, and before they even knew what they had, they patented it, and packaged it, and slapped it on a plastic lunchbox, and now they're selling it, they wanna sell it. Well... I don't think they deserve any credit for the 2020 chip.

Whether it is medical statistics, political, statistics, or sports statistics, I just love crunching numbers. I also love watching basketball and playing it.

I gotta say, I don‚Äôt hate this team. As much as I hated let‚Äôs say, the 2014 Lakers. However, I find this seem to be very inefficient to say the least.

I think that this squad has some potential to grow how much potential can they really readjust? 

So the above picture is the stats that I gave the Lakers on NBA 2K 23 made by yours truly. I have about 16 years of experience adjusting rosters and it‚Äôs one of my extremely boring and mundane and hobbies (FR3AKYD on XB). 

-	 Anthony Davis has been a low 80 ever since we won the championship. He has top-five DPOY numbers, but some of the worst offense at the power/center position in the NBA, at least, for starters. How much more room does this guy have to sort of return to what he once was in 2020? What about who he was in New Orleans? Is this the Davis that we are now going to have to expect? A top-five defensive talent with below average offense missing 20 to 30 games a year? 
-	LeBron is in my opinion potentially the biggest reason why we are playing so bad. I don‚Äôt think I have ever seen LeBron this low ever since I started playing basketball related video games. I started back in 2006 and I got to tell you‚Ä¶ This is very worrying. He‚Äôs playing absolutely‚Ä¶ Regular. And that‚Äôs the problem at the age of 38 and year 20. I don‚Äôt really see how much more he can turn this up but if there ever was a player to do it, it would be him I just feel the need to remind everybody that after the ‚Äò95/96 NBA season, a noticeable downward trend, began to hit Jordan. It was even more evident in the 98 season. I think we are now witnessing LeBron‚Äôs significant decline as he has been dropping every single season since 2020.
-	It‚Äôs good to see Russell Westbrook play the best basketball he has played since he was on the Rockets. I still feel that he is extremely inefficient with his 32% assist percentage and a 20% turnover rate percentage. However, he was playing a decent amount better than he was last season, and he is potentially playing the best defense of his entire career!
-	A lot of players on this team are playing some outstanding defense and shooting absolute diarrhea out there. Shout outs to Reeves, Beverly, Gabriel, and Jones. They‚Äôre doing something right while also doing something really wrong. Hopefully they work it out.
-	The final point I will make is what the fuck happened to Kendrick Nunn. I don‚Äôt think I have ever seen a more disappointing player projection than this guy. I literally saw this motherfucker was one step away from becoming a solid, NBA starter‚Ä¶ A pure shooting point guard. Nope. The man has dropped off from what I thought was a 77 back in 2020 to a 66 today. The man would basically just be a role player in the G league at this point.",1.0

- AD looked really good tonight, he was decisive and strong on offense and a force on defense. I thought he did a decent job on Markennan. He still has it when we prioritize him on offense. 

- Russ looked solid as well honestly. His burst seemed to still be present, the finishing was pretty iffy and the jumper was atrocious. The decision making on offense and defense was questionable as usual, but he played with force. 

- My biggest surprise was seeing that Austin Reaves was clearly the 3rd best player for us. He battled on D, made smart decisions in transition and drove hard to the basket and drew fouls. 

- Damien Jones, Wenyan Gabriel, and Matt Ryan do not belong in any NBA rotation other than being 11th or 12th men. Overall I don‚Äôt believe all is lost if we make a trade. I know that‚Äôs a belief that is dying out but they really looked good in the first half. I just don‚Äôt trust Pelinka to make the right moves.

He clearly has the backing of the front office so I don‚Äôt know why he caved in so easily? Also in hindsight, that Buddy Hield trade he had lined up was pretty bad as well. Move the two first round picks I don‚Äôt give a flying fuck about the 2029 pick, that‚Äôs a seventh grader right now. Kid probably ain‚Äôt even have his first kiss yet and the Lakers are wasting Bron‚Äôs twilight years for him. Trade Russ and the two picks for Myles and Buddy.

But there‚Äôs a few reason to be optimistic.

- *Lonnie Walker IV* - As much as we harp on Lonnie‚Äôs play, he is actually setting career high marks on PER, BPM, and WS/48. This tells me he is developing under Darvin Ham. 
- *Westbench* - WB is in the late Bill Walton stage of his career (former MVP turned super sub). He can yield a good return from a tanking team like the Hornets or the Pistons. I could see him returning to OKC. That said, this is turning out to be a good bounce back season for him.
-  *Player Development* - In my opinion, we have 3 role payers that we must bring back next season: Austin Reaves, Wenyen Gabriel, and Troy Brown, Jr. These guys are improving and  going to to be key rotation players.
- *LeBron‚Äôs Milestone* - If this team peaks as a play-in tournament squad, then the highlight for the season would be LeBron passing Kareem. Last season, there was some jump in his scoring around the All-Star break.

The season is still early and I think the team should pick up a couple wins that will boost fan optimism.",1.0

1722,2022-11-09 01:12:59,yq4g4u,Has father time caught up to LeBron? Comparing his stats to the start of last season,imadogg,"If yall have been on twitter, r/nba, this sub, etc etc you'd have seen the nonstop talk of Lebron literally being 55 years old and/or dead.

# There's been numerous comparisons to last season's Bron and his seemingly steep decline this year. For a refresher, highlights of last year:

* 30.3ppg - 2nd best of his entire career, first time surpassing 30ppg in 14 seasons
* 52.4%fg - 6th best of his career, best of his Lakers career
* 35.9% from 3 - 6th best of his career vs 62% from 2 - 2nd best of his career. 75.6%ft which is his 5th best
* Overall stats of 30/8/6/1/1 which is wild overall... but psycho for a guy in his age 37 season

# How's he doing this year? In 9 games played out of 10 possible so far:

* 24.3ppg - 2nd worst of his career - only rookie season was worse
* 44.7%fg - see above. Worst since rookie year
* 21% from 3 - by far his worst ever. His 55.6% from 2 is in the middle, and 68.2%ft is 3rd worst ever
* Overall stats of 24/9/7/1/1 which is still respectable overall. But that efficiency is rough

# Now that that's out of the way, lets take a look at how Bron started last season. Stats for his first 9 games:

* Did not play in his 9th game of the season until the Lakers' 20th game. 9/20 gp vs 9/10 games this year.
* Stats of 24.6/5/6.1 last season vs 24.3/8.9/7.1 this season
* Splits of 48.3%/36.6%/79.4% last season vs 44.7/21%/68.2% this year

# So... is Lebron dead?

Possibly, possibly not. Time catches up to us all. 

But he started last year with similar/worse counting stats, and more injured when compared to this season. 

The biggest thing is his *putrid* shooting this season. If he can even get his 3% up to a *crappy* 30.5% and his ft up to a *meh* 70%, all of a sudden we're at 26.5ppg on 48% shooting. It would be unprecedented for shooting out of all things to permanently fall off a cliff like this, so I'd bet on that normalizing a bit. 

Hopefully we can stop freaking out about father time killing off Bron. Though the Lakers still suck ass unfortunately.",1.0

One of the largest franchises in the NBA is perhaps the largest market in the sport was ruined by the fecklessness of it's ownership. The Lakers might be headed in a similar direction with the way things are headed. 

The team which has historically held much appeal for basketball superstars due to it's history and the vibrancy of the city is based in has been subject to gross mismanagement. Ruining this current superstar talent and refusal to do anything to fix things will sway any future superstar from the team, especially with the Clippers being in much better hands and being nurtured by a passionate owner with an unlimited treasure trove to offer them the best of both worlds. 

The only positive for this organization is the great scouting department with an eye for talent. But even then, drafting without the ability to attract superstars is not a recipe for the consistent success a franchise like Lakers demands. Surely the front office understand this no?",1.0

Post Nash / Howard disaster, still was willing to watch Kobe in his twilight, at least that was fun.

Last year I was willing to watch almost every game because I held onto hope that we could squeeze into the playoffs. Joke was on me obviously. 

The point is I feel like i can tell myself honestly that i appreciate this team for the reasons you're ""supposed to"". Except now. We fucking suck and it sounds like everyone in the organization has just accepted that already. I'm not going to give my time and energy to watching us eat ass.

But it was wasted once they traded for Westbrook. No point in chasing a lost cause. Which I think is obvious to most people. But what isn't is a rebuild makes no sense either. The most valuable asset in a rebuild is having control of your own pick. We do not have that until 2025 at the earliest. So even trading AD and even LeBron would just put us in limbo of mediocre draft picks until we would be able to take advantage of tanking in 2025. 

Best course of action would be to hope AD and LeBron don't age out too fast and rebuild around them with actual starter quality NBA players instead of a hodgepodge of minimum contract players struggling to be in the league.",1.0

ESPN would cover it immediately the next morning and create a new narrative that the problem is the front office, which has already been marinating for a while. 

Look at what‚Äôs happening with the Washington Commanders, fans are chanting to sell amidst the rumors of several potential buyers, and it‚Äôs looking like it may happen. Whose to say that it couldn‚Äôt work again?

I‚Äôm not looking at ownership being a problem in the current year, even though it is, but it being a continuous problem 25+ years or so down the line. Of course that sounds drastic, but when you look at the teams lack of success since the passing of Dr. Jerry Buss, it looks grim for the future. 

Look at LeBron‚Äôs years as a Laker:

2018-19: 4th seed before injury, miss the playoffs
2019-20: Win Championship
2020-21: Win Play In, Lose in first round to red hot Suns team
2021-22: Miss Playoffs
2022-23: You are here (2-8 as of writing) 

The success with LeBron, despite a championship, has been underwhelming. This isn‚Äôt his fault at all, as he‚Äôs played LeBron basketball every year and has always been consistent. You can make a lot of ‚Äúthey would have‚Äù scenarios in your head, but the fact is we‚Äôve only been to one Finals with LeBron, and only twice to the playoffs. Compare that to Miami, and both stints in Cleveland, where LeBron was always in the playoffs, and had 8 consecutive Finals visits. What the Lakers have given LeBron is unforgivable, and it provides a negative side to the franchise that free agents wouldn‚Äôt like to look at. 

Toward the end of Kobe‚Äôs play, ESPN had those segments about the idea that nobody wanted to play with Kobe. I think it‚Äôs becoming more clear that it wasn‚Äôt a Kobe issue, it was a Lakers issue.

Lakers are taking the spotlight right now because we are the biggest team and have the worst record. With how shit other teams are playing, we could be somewhat 'competitive'. Remember we had the hardest schedule the first 10 games.

For example, the mavs have started off hot but just lost to the magic without banchero. Luka been avg 36 but that isnt sustainable. The warriors have been trash despite beating us. I would argue they have performed the worst considering the schedule they had. The timberwolves are 5-6 right now. Pelicans are 5-5. They are 3 wins away from us and we've been horrible. The clippers and nuggets look effy considering they were the favorites to win the west. Also, the blazers are 7-3 right now and i'm not buying into that.

I don't care if he is soft or not. He simply can't play at a 5 for the whole game. Its been evident for a long time. Its hardly a surprise his best season in 2019-2020 was when he played alongside another big in Javale/Dwight and only played at 5 for short stretches and to close the 4th quarter.

If you're not getting a good big to take the load off him, then please trade him to a good team who won't put him out there destined to fail. Don't ruin a player. Its gross mismanagement of a player and your team's asset.

And yet here we are, with the FO doing the complete opposite of what he should have been, putting G-League level players around LBJ and AD. Seriously, how can you be so incompetent? I can't understand, it almost seems like they're ruining this team on purpose. It doesn't make any sense to me.

If at the beginning of the season they had made the trades and found good role players to support LBJ and AD (good shooters, decent defenders and a Center) and we would be contenders right now. I still believe that if the trades are made even at this point in the season, we could easily be a playoff team. And in the playoffs, having guys like LBJ and AD on your team, well, anything can happen. Then next season you make the right moves here and there, and you have a top contender team.

My opinion:

Trade Lebron for McCollum and our picks, add fillers and sweeteners as needed.

Trade for Westbrook/AD for Kyrie/Simmons.

Turn around and trade Simmons for Kawhi and West.

We then banish Kyrie by playing hard poker with him and the media (this might be the hardest thing to do TBH). Take the L for league, W for La La Land.

KD and Westbrook get to play decent ball for an audience that‚Äôs hungry for stability.

AD might play. It‚Äôs up to him and his body, no matter where he is, TBH.

Lebron probably catches up to MJ and passes him in goat status by leading a young developing team into a ring or two and as an aged star in a struggling market.

Hire solid coaching and development. Nash, Vogel, and Snyder are available. Pay them very well, and have them develop a new
Team culture. Give them full control, no imperative to win, just develop solid players. Scout deep into the second round and the far reaches of the earth. Diamonds in the rough.

Laker fans stop being entitled and accept a proper tank. People will say this is LA and stars want to be here. It doesn‚Äôt matter if we field shitty teams. And they need to get it in their head, Tatum has a good chance of leading Boston to a few rings. We get two solid veterans in Kawhi and McCollum, and they don‚Äôt have to win, just play well in the biggest market and lead young talent.

Jeanie eats Crow, fires her advisors, and apologizes to The Logo.

- Other core players on the roster would also prefer those picks be used to improve this year's team

What a thrilling start to the season. Nobody could have predicted this kind of start and I mean literally nobody.
We're winning games, playing a winning style of basketball, developing young players and winning habits all at the same time.
Things are practically perfect...
Except this sub is bumming me out. After every dub I come to ) r/lakersto revel in victory. Yet after even wins, there are several disgruntled posts regarding things like: westbrook' playing time,lebron playing time, worrying aboutrob pelinka fit in the rotation, trading Kyle Kuzma,Oubre‚Äôs inability to finish at the rim, and so on.
These are all
legitimate conversations but there is a better time and place to show concern and complain. The goal of the games is TO WIN. When the team WINS, the fans should be HAPPY. Not WHINY. There's no guarantee that this season will continue going well. A number of things could happen to deter the team after an incredible start. So please, I'm begging you guys, enjoy this incredible and unlikely start to the season. Sections of the fan base are coming off as entitled and unappreciative.

1998,2022-11-11 18:45:50,ysj5is,[Delusional Thought] What if all this Jeanie/Rob vs Klutch/Bron feud talk is just FO‚Äôs desperate measure at gaining some trade leverage?,YoungEmperorLBJ,"I came into the season quite optimistic about the team, especially after watching the preseason and the first 8 games thinking even the results ain‚Äôt there, the team is making good progress and doing all the right things amid historically bad shooting luck. The guys are leaving everything on the court and that‚Äôs refreshing considering what we saw last season. But now I am utterly dejected and depressed. AD and Bron‚Äôs already shaky health is taking even more beating because FO just ignores what‚Äôs happening in the court. Especially after all the news about Jeanie being a cheapass bitch and Pelinka acting like her dog, I am losing whatever hope and optimism I have left. 

I admit I am a Lebron fan first. As an international fan I feel no particular attachment to any NBA city but I‚Äôve been following Bron since 06 and is captivated by his play, probably like how MJ captivated so many back in the 80s and 90s. I saw MJ in person at a Wizards game in 02 and even though he‚Äôs still MJ it was kinda sad watching him go out on a mediocre team. I feel the same about Bron‚Äôs final years now.

So here comes my extreme mental gymnastics. The Jeanie/Pelinka stuff that was leaked out could possibly be FO trying to gain the last bit of trade leverage. Here‚Äôs why:

1. Before the season, everyone was saying how lakers need to win some games with Russ to not seem desperate for trade. IMO that‚Äôs complete crap. Every opposing FO knows Russ will be traded no matter the record. Even if the Lakers are 19-1 before Thanksgiving, Russ is still a big negative in the playoffs. There is no leverage to be gained there. The only fringe scenario is that Russ plays so well that someone might want him. But given his salary, no team that‚Äôs competing will trade for him.

2. The only leverage the Lakers can get is if other FO actually believes Lakers aren‚Äôt trading their picks no matter what, which is exactly the message we‚Äôve gotten this past few days.

3. Lebron/Klutch putting a piece expressing their displeasure via Haynes further shows other FO that this whole thing is real. We know both of the Lakers picks are extremely valuable so they may wanna get what they can out of the lakers and finally start to negotiate in good faith.

I am probably just completely delusional.",1.0

If LeGM has no fans, it‚Äôs because I no longer exist.

The lakers recently are constantly looking for the short cut to team building. They skip out on the smaller details. They mess up mid tier signings, trade important role players, and mess up min and Tax Payer signings. They attempt to cover up their incompetence by going after star after stars to avoid having to draft well, develop talent, retain talent, and identify value signings. 

To name a few mess ups below:

Losing Smaller Trades:
Zubacs trade
Thomas Bryant
Schroeder 

Overpaying big trades:
Russ Trade
AD trade

Missed resignings:
Wes Matthews
Caruso 
Lopez

Bad signings:
Most of the min guys last year
Nunn

Coach:
Being too cheap to hire Lue

TLDR: the constant third star pursuit is an attempt to cover up all of management‚Äôs mess ups. It‚Äôs the equivalent of the novice poker player going all in almost every hand. Once in a while you win (2020) by going all in but usually you fall on your face.",0.92

I was on board with trading THT for him because Pat helps the team now, while THT was a guy for the future and wasn‚Äôt ready to step into a huge role on a team with championship expectations. 

With the Pat Bev trade, I figured that pointed toward the direction of the Lakers making a move off of Russ and getting other role players like Buddy and Myles. So far though, the Lakers FO seems content with just letting this season play out as a disaster. 

If their mindset was always that this team wasn‚Äôt going to be real good and that would lead them to not being aggressive in trades, then why trade a young, 21 year old, who I think is going to develop into a really nice player, for a 34 year old who‚Äôs a win now player?

My homie told me Pat Bev doesn‚Äôt work if you don‚Äôt have shooting because he‚Äôs not a guy guy he‚Äôs a glue guy who talks to young guys, plays d and maybe hits a few shots. But even then he is expected to do a job. He has been a 38% shooter his whole career and since being a Laker he can‚Äôt hit the side of the barn. If he didn‚Äôt talk shit then he‚Äôd jus be another role player who misses shots once the stage lights turn on in Hollywood. But given all the shit he talks its normal to be upset. 

I know its been early but when u have a 2-10 start staying optimistic is really tough. Unless the team can cut some dudes and sign positive reinforcements theres not a lot that can be done. Either that or the team jus has to get better one way or the next the old fashion way. Bev needs to get benched like Nunn. With Dennis yeah he‚Äôll prob be a better starter than Bev cuz while he isn‚Äôt a shooter he is at least a bit more competent as a playmaker kinda but even then while he‚Äôll prob fit a bit better it still won‚Äôt be perfect given the fact he is coming back from thumb surgery with TB and we all seen how THT shot got broke after that shit.  Therefore its a tough spot to be in. Bev can‚Äôt start, Darvin Ham gotta pull the plug on him simple and plain.

We would have kept KCP and Kuzma. We would have had money to re-sign Caruso. We'd have our pick that we traded for Westbrook. That move would also have put us in a prime spot to land DeRozan. I remember working that math out last year. We could have offered DeRozan around ~20m and Caruso around ~9m and still had space to fill out a roster under the hard cap. 

&amp;nbsp;

In hindsight not making that trade is even more baffling considering we traded THT for a guy who is averaging 5 PPG on 28% shooting. I remember saying at the time that not making that trade ended the Lakers championship window forever, it's still a hill I'll always die on.",1.0

I remember feeling optimistic after the trade bc it was like ‚Äúoh nice a 3/D point guard to help us, we must be now about to trade Russ for 2-3 more shooters/defenders to round out our role players. 

It now turns out that not only is Bev not providing enough D, he‚Äôs also providing us essentially zero in the 3 category as well. 

Basically, I‚Äôm trying to think of how we could have built this roster out competently from the summer given the assets we had. 

It‚Äôs hard to know which players were potentially available to us via trade, but if you were Pelinka, what moves would you have made as of July 1 2022 to best situate us for this season? Would you still trade for Bev and then flip Russ for wings/shooting, or do a different deal than the Bev deal while still trading Russ and picks for wings/shooting? Any key players in mind?

Its not the same as when the team sucked after Kobe tore his Achilles because they weren‚Äôt expected to win after that lets be honest.  But I feel once you get expectations and you got the whole world paying attention judging your losses its tough to watch. (2021 wasn‚Äôt the same because I think while that team wasn‚Äôt perfect injuries is why they failed more than anything and the role players put up a solid effort to make the playoffs in the first place)

Watching Russ reputation almost fall by the wayside going from being an MVP to a laughing stock in his own city even tho he is turning the corner since accepting a 6th man role. Watching AD health decline. Seeing all those former stars show there age too. Then the one win to only get disappointed the next game. Not to mention the FO turning into a shit show.

2159,2022-11-12 21:14:31,ytijz3,SERIOUS: Fixes the Lakers Can Make WITHOUT Blowing Up the Team Just Yet - From a Fan of 30 Years,Trustthefundamentals,"Well, folks. Here we are at 2-10. As fans, it's easy for us to watch games, see a Win/Loss record, and presume ""Bad roster - fire Jeanie and Pelinka"". Yes, there are some bad fits. But this is actually not a bad roster. It's a redundant one, but not one that is so bad and redundant that it should be winning less than 20% of its games. This SHOULD be good enough talent to make the playoffs. Lebron and AD are still both top 20 players in the league. Under average shooting has exposed the roster, but there are still ways to be a competent offense in the league, even with one of the most important skillsets in today's game being a weakness. I still believe that this team has top 12 overall talent in the league simply because of our two stars. A small minority of you may actually still believe this too, despite our record. If we didn't believe this team was capable of much better, it wouldn't be so mind numbing seeing these results. It's a lot more painful to start a season this dreadful when you have LeBron/AD vs. the ""Baby Lakers"" years, when we were expected to lose due to our lack of experience and expected untapped talent.

&amp;#x200B;

This 2022-23 Lakers team is not being utilized properly. More needs to be placed on the coaches, not the players. Losses have surmounted due to a combination of poor strategy and a very difficult schedule to start the season. The 3rd through 8th best players on the Lakers are actually not scrubs as the media portrays them to be. Beverley, Reaves, Walker, Nunn, Brown, Westbrook, Schroder (when back) are all rotational players on most NBA teams. Some of you may not agree. But if you look at these players' statistics and contributions in previous seasons, they are statistically fine players who belong in the NBA. This is not the 2011-12 Bobcats, who literally had players that would struggle in today's G League. Instead of simply saying the team can't shoot (which has been less of an issue in recent games), we should be honing in on the fact they are being misused and underutilized. There is an overreliance on Russell Westbrook, who most of us were hoping to see less of after Vogel departed. Even LeBron James is probably handling the ball too much when he could still be plenty impactful as more of an entry man in the post, as he was used as often last season.

&amp;#x200B;

The fact of the matter is that several Lakers are not used in the roles they have thrived in on previous teams, and our half court offense is abysmal. Similar to last season, the team is so hesitant to get into a half court offense that they will often force fast breaks that will result in either a layup or turnover. The Lakers are #1 in the league in offensive pace. They are 2-9. It's clear that pace isn't the key to success. And it's because playing this fast results in far too many turnovers. Therefore, half court offense has to improve.

&amp;#x200B;

If you are on team ""Lakers suck, and there's nothing we can do at this point"", this post is not for you. I don't believe this roster sucks. I believe Ham and the coaching staff is not familiar enough with their own roster yet to understand their capabilities. Good teams have players fall into specific roles. Our team seems to almost be in a trial phase, where Lonnie Walker (not a 3-point shooter) is still taking a ton of perimeter shots and Juan Toscano-Anderson (not an NBA player) is still getting a jersey to tuck in. Darvin Ham has not gotten nearly enough flack for how he has managed this team thus far. It's time.

&amp;#x200B;

The following are my insights, thoughts, and suggestions to our coaching staff. If by some miracle, some of this can actually be seen by someone on the Lakers' payroll, great. Perhaps there is a way to at least make this season entertaining and competitive for us fans from here on out. I actually believe the CURRENT team (without a trade needed to sacrifice our future) can still improve and play more cerebral basketball to become competitive. Whether or not it's too late for the team to make the play-in is up for debate, but for a roster that could and should still be considered a better than average one, this is a long list of thoughts I've been writing since the beginning of the season that would at least get this team closer to their potential:

&amp;#x200B;

* Most of us (but not all) would probably say that this roster looks better than one season ago, when the supporting cast was packed with old players past their primes who were physically incapable of defending. Yes, better shooting with players like Carmelo and Monk. But if we could trade those two for Lonnie Walker and Troy Jones, who have both been impressive, I believe we'd mostly take the two we have now. Beverley is an improvement over Augustin, and I'd even take a healthy but struggling Damian Jones over last year's hobbled Dwight Howard. Reaves and Gabriel have both improved over last year, and actually looked quite good against the Kings. And MOST IMPORTANTLY, Lebron, Davis, and Westbrook have mostly played together, despite nagging injuries. Last year's team saw  LeBron James, Anthony Davis and Russell Westbrook play a total of 21 games together last season. Many fans seem to think we missed the playoffs due to lack of talent. But the reality is that the Lakers were still likely to sneak into a playoff spot before Davis' final bad ankle sprain from landing on Gobert's foot. The Spurs didn't even seem to care about beating out the Lakers for that final spot, but it was essentially gifted after so many devastating injuries. This said, last year's team started 7-5 through their first 12. This team will either be 2-10 or 3-9 after today's Nets game, with what should be considered an objectively better (and healthier) roster.  

&amp;#x200B;

* Now on to Darvin Ham: This Lakers team is not the 2019 to 2021 Milwaukee Bucks well-rounded roster that Darvin Ham is used to. This is obviously an understatement, but not necessarily just because the Bucks were and are significantly more talented. This Lakers team actually has some very solid pieces that could collectively be good enough to be a playoff team if used remotely correctly. I actually believe this. Poorly constructed roster? Sure. All Pelinka's fault? Probably a stretch, but I get the people that are calling for his head. But what about Ham? Even if the modern NBA is generally played in a drive-and-dish, spread offense style now that puts a premium on open shot makers and less on foul drawing, there actually IS a way to win games without average or above average open shot makers. However, Darvin Ham designs this team's offense to play like we have a Khris Middleton, Brook Lopez, or even Bobby Portis level of shooter to dish out to. Going from above average to below average on the perimeter offense hasn't seemed to make a difference in how many perimeter shots we take. This is what he is used to. This Lakers' roster was built with an abundance of playmaking guards who are mainly all average to under average in shooting. Yes, this is a disadvantage that any coach would have to struggle with, to an extent. Especially when our forwards are also mainly average to under average shooters, and the guards don't have anyone to pass to for jump shots either. In Milwaukee, Ham was one of many coaches who were part of systems that completely abandoned midrange jumpshots. This is understandable. In the past decade, 10-20 foot 2-point jumpshots were assessed as inefficient, and were dramatically and noticeably removed from league offenses beginning around the 2014-15 season. This Lakers' roster, however, is an outlier to the modern NBA. The majority of the top talent on this team relies on driving and slashing. However, almost stubbornly, Ham is still having the Lakers shoot a league average amount of 3-pointers. It actually WOULD be ok if we took mid-range shots, which many of our players would feel more comfortable doing. Lonnie Walker is one player that has actually shown a nice talent in taking and making mid-rangers. He is NOT a great three-point shooter yet in his career. Let him work to his strengths! This is essentially the equivalent of having an NFL team with a top 5 runningback get minimized to 12 carries a game because his coach runs a pass-first scheme offense. This is an oversight that I'm not seeing addressed enough anywhere.

&amp;#x200B;

* I haven't seen enough of Darvin Ham yet in games and interviews to call him a poor coach. Most fans just judge based on the players they see, and whether they make or miss their shots. And the Lakers have had just the right kind of scapegoats (Westbrook, no shooting, Lebron sick, Davis has no dog in him) to have Ham really dodge any sort of bullets so far as the Lakers' head coach. But I do believe it's time fans and the media begin to take a look at him more seriously.

&amp;#x200B;

* In general, I think people break down coaching pro athletes as being skilled at 
   * 1) Motivating players with big egos who are the best on the planet at what they do and get paid exorbitant amounts of money.
   * 2) Coming up with strategies to get the most out of each player and work to their strengths, while hiding their weaknesses. As an example, Brad Stevens comes to mind as a great coach, who I predict will return to coaching at some point. He was amazing at getting the most out of a player like Isiah Thomas on the offensive end, while hiding his weakness on the defensive end with great help defense. Steve Kerr and Erik Spoelstra are considered great defenders due to their mastery at getting untapped potential out of journeymen and role players. You'll also notice that their teams are always setting screens for their ball handlers to allow stars like Steph Curry or Jimmy Butler to force switches on to inferior defenders to create more quality shots. Is this something we do? I haven't seen it. Say what you will about Vogel. But last season, Vogel was good at identifying Westbrook as a negative defender, and came up with schemes to have players help him on defense to prevent him from getting exploited. Eventually, his defensive schemes didn't matter because he lost the locker room. So even though he was a fairly good coach (in my eyes), his lack of skill as a coach was on the motivating end. It was no surprise that after Lakers management fired Vogel, they wanted to swing the pendulum toward a motivating ""Players' Coach"". And this is exactly what Darvin Ham's reputation was around the league, going back to his assistant days with the Lakers a decade ago. The thought made sense, as the front office felt that particular players like Westbrook fell off mainly due to his clashing with Vogel (even though it was moreso due to his declining athleticism). Ham has indeed been showing a positive relationship with Westbrook, which has led Russ to showing an uptick in his play. However, the elephant in the room is that Darvin Ham has failed to provide a good offensive system for this Lakers' roster. There is a ton of iso ball, a severe lack of screens, and a below league average amount of uncontested shots for his players.

&amp;#x200B;

* The Lakers don't just have low shooting percentages because they have under average shooters. They have low shooting percentages because Ham's offensive designs aren't giving them as many open looks as most NBA teams. It's impossible to know about the schemes and adjustments discussed in the Lakers' locker room. However, there have been hints of Ham's limitations as a ""strategy"" coach. The white board that said ""Contest Without Fouling"" was meme'd, and not really considered a big deal. But let's stop and think about what a good coach would do to get a team to do something that literally every team tries to do (contest without fouling). Great coaches in the NBA have historically come up with schemes to distract jump shooting as much as possible. Popovich's championship Spurs teams were notable for being one of the hardest to pump fake. Pop instilled those teams to allow defenders to take long shots over them and to stay on the ground at all costs. Because it's better to lightly contest a jump shot than to allow a free blow-by for a layup after a pumpfake.

&amp;#x200B;

* A few games back, when Ham was asked why Davis didn't take more 2nd half shots after a loss, he mentioned that ""Davis is free to call his own name whenever he wants it."" This sounds fine on the surface... Our initial reaction is ""Oh ok, good I guess... Ham lets his players have the freedom to dictate the game for themselves. We don't want a dictator anyways!"" But in reality, NBA players NEED to know when they should be having their name called. Especially when the roster is so unfamiliar with each other, and full of so many first-year Lakers who have never played with one another. When I think of a comparison for Ham, I see a bit of Doc Rivers. Doc has always been considered a ""Player's Coach"" who got his Celtics teams in particular to fight hard on defense. At the same time, Doc's offensive schemes have never appeared to be anything special, he was recently named as a ""Top 15 Coach of All Time"", which I think the public correctly laughed off after that was announced. Similarly, I believe Ham got a bit of an overbloated reputation due to the Bucks' championship run 2 seasons ago, where he was a primary assistant on that team. Combine this with him being generally known around the league as a ""good dude"", and you have a coach who I believe isn't particularly strong on strategy and adjustments. Underprepared coaches typically get exposed the most in the 3rd quarter. And I think most of you know about the Lakers' infamous 3rd quarter struggles thus far, after teams come out adjusted to the Lakers' ""gameplans"". My worst fear, really since Phil Jackson's departure, is that the Lakers would go after coaches who would be ""friends"" with their players to get the most out of them. Coaches who take this route generally are not the biggest on strategy. They're more about the belief that their players ""just have to want it more..."" which seems to be a good enough mantra to be successful with once every 20 years.  At the end of the day, basketball is a game based on outwitting your opponent as much as dominating them athletically. And the Lakers have time and time again gone for players' coaches that fit this ""motivator"" description, like Byron Scott and Luke Walton. We know how those ended up. Vogel, on the other hand, was arguably our first ""X's and O's"" coach since Mike D'Antoni. I fear Darvin Ham is showing early signs of being much more on the Byron/Luke side of the tracks.

&amp;#x200B;

* One other note on Ham - he's known as a defensive coach. The team started out quite impressive on the defensive side, but have reverted back to under average now. For being a first-year head coach, Ham seems to have a bit of an old school mentality on ""forcing jump shots"". Time and time again throughout these first 11 games, I've seen him scheme defensively to collapse and pack the paint to prevent easy layups, only to give up essentially any open three that opponents want to take, by the player they want taking them. The NBA has improved far too much since Ham was a player to continue giving up open threes. The average NBA player will make more than half of their uncontested threes these days, and that wasn't quite the case from his playing era in the 00's. His '04 Pistons were known for packing the paint and forcing jumpshots, and I've got a hunch that he's still implementing this kind of direction for a much different NBA talent pool of much better shooters.

&amp;#x200B;

* Moving away from Ham now and talking about the on-court product, the Lakers played better than their 2-8 record for the first 10 games of the season. The media overreacted and blamed it on the Lakers' shooting, when in fact, they had a bit of bad luck. It's also worth noting that the Lakers have a fully made-over roster for a 3rd consecutive season since their bubble championship. When new players play together, especially against top teams in the league who are very familiar with each others' capabilities, the Lakers are at a massive disadvantage. Even if the Lakers have talent on their team, which they actually do despite the media and Laker fans proclaiming otherwise. Bad luck and a few bad decisions down the stretch of a few losses caused the Lakers' coaching staff to overreact and make unnecessary changes to a team that simply had mainly close losses to mainly top 10 NBA teams their first 10 games of the season. Damion Jones and Kendrick Nunn should not be having DNP's, despite very slow starts. Jones was an extremely efficient player last season, who albeit, has offensive limitations. But his size, rebounding, and shot blocking abilities on defense have been sorely missed, while Gabriel has struggled to defend without fouling or getting blown by. Nunn was an extremely talented shot creator for the Miami Heat before his bone bruise turned him into a meme in his first season for the Lakers. It's clear he's still getting his legs back, and is not yet back to his athleticism. But I encourage fans and our coaching staff to watch some of his highlights with Miami in the bubble season. He has a lot of potential, is still very young, and these DNP's and massive minute limitations because of his poor first few games of the season, are completely masking him as one of the Lakers' 5 most impactful players that he should be having more chances to prove.

&amp;#x200B;

* Russell Westbrook having above average games his first 5 games coming off the bench was the worst thing that could have happened to the Lakers. It was ok that fans overreacted, and felt that ""Benchbrook"" was the new savior the Lakers needed. That's normal. We want our team to succeed, and sometimes that means having a selective memory of just how many abhorrent games he cost us (as recently as this season's Portland loss) In reality, Westbrook just happened to make 2-3 more open shots per game during his first 5 games off the bench. This gave an ""out"" for Ham still playing him 30+ minutes per night, when I genuinely believe Westbrook could actually have a plus impact for the team if he played 4-6 minute spurts to optimize him only when fresh, and cap out around 18-20 minutes per night. A few open threes does not mean he is changed.  These makes were enough to let fans forget about his abhorrent game ruining turnovers and poor defensive decisions. His turnovers are extremely harmful, and much more negative than, for example, a missed shot by Nunn. Turnovers create 2 on 4's, with Westbrook being the last one back after his turnovers (whether or not it's because he's busy complaining to refs about a phantom foul). The vast majority of turnovers lead to a bucket for the opposing team in today's fast paced, opportunistic NBA. Missed shots at least allow defenses to get back, and get into half court defensive sets to prevent buckets approximately half the time. This is not talked about enough, and it is shocking that it is not highlighted or emphasized more in post game interviews by Darvin Ham.

&amp;#x200B;

* The idea of ""Benchbrook"" temporarily worked for a few reasons. 1) Westbrook would come in fresh when opposing starters were beginning to get gassed. 2) Westbrook would have better success getting to the rim against opposing bench players as they began to come in for starters. 3) Westbrook would spend less time on the court with LeBron James and Anthony Davis, who require three solid off-ball players with average to above average shooting in order to exploit matchups and maximize their own efficiency by benefitting from single coverage. 4) Westbrook would play few overall minutes for the Lakers. However, due to Westbrook's first few games off the bench being such a success, Ham hasn't been able to help himself and he's been bringing Westbrook in 3 minutes into the start of each half, as opposed to 6 minutes in. This is a massive difference. Westbrook is technically still ""coming off the bench"". But coming in so early into the half essentially just makes him a de facto starter who still plays most of his time with LeBron and AD. And still plays mainly against starters. He then plays nearly 10-12 minutes straight, and still closes halves with LeBron and AD. This ruins the entire purpose of Westbrook's bench role, with his minutes not staggering against LeBron's and AD's in a significant enough way to make a difference.

&amp;#x200B;

* Darvin Ham has not stayed true to his word of holding players accountable. Watching Westbrook singlehandedly implode the Lakers' 11-point lead with 3 turnovers, a couple missed shots, and a frustration ""take foul"" in the backcourt with 2 seconds on the clock, I was actually relieved because I knew that any coaching staff would pull the player aside and talk to them about how their emotionally charged play cost the team. Instead, Darvin said nothing. In fact, the entire coaching staff sat on the bench and just complained about a previous missed call instead of talking to Westbrook about what had just transpired. 

&amp;#x200B;

* Austin Reaves should be the starting point guard. Yes, it is his second year in the league. But he is, in my opinion, the second best decision maker on the team (behind LeBron James), a better ball handler than both Westbrook and Beverley, and a better play maker than both of them as well. Reaves makes very smart decisions, often using screens to pin his man behind him and then read the defense to put up an efficient floater (if undefended) or easy dish for a layup or dunk (if defended) by the help man.

&amp;#x200B;

* Westbrook creates more flashy and aggressive offense than Reaves, which gives off the appearance that he could score any time when his speed allows him to blow by. However, his high risk/high reward play creates way too many ""flukes"". You know the ones where he goes up for a layup, and the ball soars 15 feet in the air and out of bounds, while Russ stares at the refs with his hands up. Or the ones where he gets swiped due to carelessness after what he thought was a blow-by, only to be caught by a determined defender who already made it around a screen. The difference between Reaves and Westbrook as the primary ball handler is that Reaves has an above average NBA assist to turnover ratio. Westbrook's turnovers per possession are abhorrent, after regressing back to his normal self. Russ actually started the season with an obvious determination to prove fans wrong, and went out of his way to minimize his turnovers at the expense of dialing back his aggression and losing a few of his easy layups per game. THIS was a better scenario than his high turnover/more layup self he's reverted back to. The Lakers can still score on possessions that Russ doesn't get easy layups. They can still work their offense, and find other easy shots. But the Lakers can't afford the turnovers that lead to easy opposing transition layups time and time again. Somewhere along the way, my hunch is that Darvin pulled Russ aside in the midst of this losing streak and told him to ""Just be Russ"" after seeing how well he was playing off the bench for a short sample size. His strategy with Russ is to not ""kill his confidence"" by praising him when he actually does something right, and somewhat looking the other way when he's wrong. Similar to a parent with a spoiled child that just wants to make sure they don't throw a tantrum. This false sense of confidence that Darvin instilled in him is absolutely devastating to the Lakers' ability to stay competitive in basketball games.

&amp;#x200B;

* An extra point about Reaves - his rebounding ability is vastly underrated. His hustle offensive rebounds off of his own or others' missed shots, is massively overlooked. Additionally, even if he's still a bit under weight and gets exploited when posted against defensively, his ability to contest jump shots is extremely impressive. His stats on contests show him as a plus defender, and he even spent a portion of last season as a top 10 defender on three pointers, in terms of percentage makes with him as the primary defender. Want a bold claim? I believe Reaves is the 3rd most valuable overall player on this roster. And he was already a top 5 player on the Lakers as a rookie last year, in terms of his plus offense and average defense (before he bulked up this offseason). Behind LeBron and Davis, Reaves makes the most consistent winning plays for the team. Just as I believe Caruso was the 3rd MVP for the team during our championship 2020 season. Yes, they're both white. It's coincidental, let's get over it. They're drastically different players (Caruso is more valuable than Reaves overall at this point in both players' careers, but not by as far as many think). If Reaves played over 32 minutes per game, the Lakers would win more basketball games. Ham hasn't realized his skill yet, and I believe it's due to his outward appearance. Let's see how long it takes for our coaching staff to figure out what I think is clear as day about Reaves' value. By mid season, I believe we'll see Reaves starting every game. It's just disappointing that coaches who see him every day in practice, haven't figured it out yet.

&amp;#x200B;

* Damion Jones should be playing more minutes. His offensive abilities are limited, but the coaching staff mainly overreacted to a few poor early games and exiled him for not playing the pick and roll well enough with Lebron and AD. He can still be a serviceable big without playing a great pick and roll game, and he has shown flashes of potential especially when put in the dunker's position. Dwight Howard and JaVale McGee were also not great pick and roll centers. However, in the Lakers' 2020 championship season, they did exactly what Damion Jones should be getting coached to do - When on offense, his size alone should be enough to keep his defender near the rim to prevent lobs. On defense, he is an average to above average presence with length and the ability to challenge any shot within 5 feet of the basket. He needs to improve his pick and roll defense. And I believe the coaching staff incorrectly identified him as just ""unplayable"" because he hasn't figured out how to use his size appropriately to stop screen and rolls consistently yet. This is a problem. But not enough of a problem to give his minutes to Wenyen Gabriel (a less impactful player overall), and force Anthony Davis to play the position he's uncomfortable playing.

&amp;#x200B;

* Wenyen Gabriel should be playing more power forward alongside Damion Jones. I like that he's actually playing decent minutes, and I hope he stays around 20 per game. His post offense has actually become acceptable where he can drop in some gimmies and putbacks around the rim. Last year, he looked like an oversized deer on ice. More importantly, the Lakers' defense is being exploited due to lack of size and lack of adjustments. Good teams like the Nuggets, Cavs, Jazz (surprisingly), Warriors, and Clippers exploit mismatches on almost every possession they set up their half court offense. Because of the lack of size when Gabriel's 6'9"" frame (which feels longer due to wingspan) is off the court, opponents are driving to the basket for lightly contested or uncontested shots within 5 feet of the hoop. Or they're just straight up shooting over undersized defenders guarding a position up like Westbrook, Walker, and Reaves. This is a WORSE problem for defenses than having two slow-footed bigs on the floor that can be exploited for threes by small guards. We should be trying more of the latter. They're no 2020 Howard and McGee being paired with Davis. But when Davis is off the floor, I'd love to see our two healthy backup bigs playing together and just trying an old school style of bully ball congested post play on offense with our undershooting squad. And with both bigs on defense, at the very least, lightly contested threes over our tallest bench players is a better option than allowing teams to exploit our undersized defense that can be shot over consistently from anywhere on the floor. 

&amp;#x200B;

* Both fans and our coaching staff overreacted to Kendrick Nunn's poor start, even after seeing him play quite strong in the preseason. Keeping him on such a short leash has ruined Nunn's confidence, and he has been forcing the issue with poor shots to try and impress the coaching staff into letting him back on the court. The way he has been exhiled reminds me of how Kent Bazemore started last season in the rotation before shooting poorly and inevitably getting DNP's after the first 2 weeks of last season. The difference is that Bazemore is trash, and probably didn't belong on an NBA rotation last season in the first place. The Lakers just accidentally made the right decision to bench him because he started the season missing a handful of open threes. Kendrick Nunn is NOT trash. He simply had a very poor start to the season, and them started to try and overcompensate by playing unsuccessful hero ball during the few minutes he's still been receiving in the last 5 games. Our coaching staff isn't familiar enough to know what he is capable of doing. I have consistently gotten the impression that analytics and previous seasonal statistics (or even tapes) have not been reviewed very sufficiently by Darvin Ham and company.

&amp;#x200B;

* When Patrick Beverley is on the court, he should always guard the opposing team's point guard. Analytics point to him being one of the best on-ball guards against other point guards in the league. The experiment of having him guard shooting guards and small forwards often negates Beverley's impact due to opponents simply being able to shoot over him. The decision to have Beverley guard shooting guards and small forwards is especially poor when he is on the court at the same time as Westbrook. Westbrook has more success guarding taller players than Beverley does, due to his strength. Westbrook's biggest weakness on defense is his inability to prevent blow-by's. Beverley is historically strong at staying in front of his men.

&amp;#x200B;

* Juan Toscano is a fringe NBA player who should not be playing more than 8 minutes per game on any team, let alone the Lakers. Ham seems to like him because he gives defensive hustle and has slightly above average size for a small forward. He seems to be a decent defender when it comes to fighting through screens. However, he isn't particularly a very good on-ball defender, and wasn't particularly good at being such with the Warriors last season either. I believe he is purely getting minutes, and perhaps even a roster spot, due to Steph Curry's ring he gifted him last season. I understand his heritage is good PR, and all of Los Angeles wants him to succeed (myself included). But the reality is that he is not one of the Lakers' best 12 players. I actually believe Matt Ryan's presence as a spacer alone makes him more valuable, even if Toscano brings marginally better defense to the table. Both get blown by on defense, and the Lakers could use a three-point sniper (their biggest weakness) a lot more than the replicable strengths that Toscano brings as an 8th or 9th man.

&amp;#x200B;

* In general, the Lakers do not set enough screens on offense. When they are being set, a comically large percentage of them are correctly identified by the refs as offensive fouls. Wenyen Gabriel plays with fire with more than half of his screens by pushing off on the defender to get our ball handler extra room. Wenyen Gabriel is not a star player who can get away with gray area pushoffs in the NBA. The coaching staff, very obviously, has not worked with Gabriel enough on pick and rolls. Anthony Davis has also not been held accountable enough as being a poor screener. The difference with him is not that he can't set successful screens. It's that he does not want to risk severe contact, and he tends to bail on screens too early or give half-hearted attempts before rolling prematurely before actually screening his assigned defender to allow his passer to feed him the ball. Damion Jones, in actuality, is our best defender. However, he can't set screens from Ham's doghouse.

&amp;#x200B;

* LeBron James is still a top 20 player in the league. Playing through an illness recently and lingering foot injury he has been carrying all season has caused his shots to be flat and short. His muscle memory on his shot completely relies upon his feet and legs giving him his strength on shots to adjust based on his distance from the basket. He has been shooting with more arms to compensate for his shots shooting short because of his foot. He knows he's a less accurate shooter while this is happening. But due to the Lakers' awful shooting their first 5 games of the season, he has convinced himself that his shot is still a better alternative to finding an open shooter. He's been wrong on that assessment, and our shooters have actually come around. But I understand his frustration and why he has opted to go for his LeFuckYou's. Nevertheless, the Lakers can't afford for him to play frustrated and suboptimal when Russell Westbrook already demonstrates this behavior on a regular basis, and at the same time.

&amp;#x200B;

This is a very long read, and I understand this kind of post may not be for everyone. But I really wanted to share some of my thoughts, based on how I've seen both Lakers teams trend between awful, mediocre, and great since I started watching as a kid in the early 90's. We all want to see this team succeed, and sometimes it's difficult to really summarize what the real problems are. They go a lot deeper than just Jeannie and Rob. And they also aren't always as deep as ""everyone"" either. When we look at a 2-10 record, it's very easy to say it's all awful. It's not, though. Bright spots like Troy Brown Jr, Austin Reaves, and Lonne Walker IV aren't just moot points. There are things to build on so that we can have more educated opinions in the product we're watching. Whether opinions like these ever reach a stubborn office, who knows? But I'll be here for all 82 games, just like I know many of you will be no matter how much irrational pain it causes us. Much love, Lakers fans.",1.0

2174,2022-11-13 01:17:28,yto1a6,The Lakers have a co-dependent and abusive relationship with the League.,3nnui,"The Lakers have won 11 titles in the past 43 years. No other team has come close, the Bulls got 6, the Spurs 5, the Celtics and Warriors 4. That has built a huge fan base, having two dynasties in 30 years will do that. The Lakers have more fans than any other team, and it's not close.

This means that when a player joins the Lakers, they will have more fame, more prestige, more fans, and more business opportunities. Everyone knows this, and it's a problem.  The league wants parity. They want to keep as many fans engaged as possible. If fans of other teams feel their teams will never compete because the best players will always go to the Lakers it will be hard to build up a fan base. This impacts the value of other teams around the league. Fandoms run on hope and the existence of the Lakers as the premier free agent destination messes with that.

Other owners don't want to pay billions for the opportunity to be a second-class citizen in the league, have no chance at a title, and have a hard time turning a profit. The Lakers dominance hits them hard in the wallet. That creates a strong incentive to do something about it. But it isn't that simple. If the Lakers are simply bad, ratings decline, there are less clicks on NBA content, less eyeballs on NBA product, Less fans in the stands when the Lakers come to town. That hits them in the wallet too. They need the Lakers to be good enough to keep fans engaged, but not so good that they dominate the league. That's what's best for business. The repeater tax placing a limit on teams being able to keep dynasties is another part of that strategy (notice even free spending GS bowed to the tax this year). 

Things came to a head when the Lakers got Gasol and two more titles. Popovich went public with his frustrations and I believe contacted the league to have something done. It's been a while, and I don't remember the exact details but he made quite a stink and I think a lot of the other franchises supported his stance, either quietly or otherwise. 

Things came to a head with ""basketball reasons"". When the league found a pretense to invalidate Chris Paul to the Lakers and then subsequently gift him to the Clippers. Imagine a still healthy kobe with the best young point guard in the league and Dwight Howard with a chance to get healthy. The owners rebelled and put a stop to it. Instead we ended up with the corpse of steve nash and a coach in Dantoni who either didn't understand how to use his roster or was actively trying to fuck us. 

The league rejoiced when the Lakers went through their rebuild. The media danced in glee when Aldridge shunned the Lakers, the days of Laker dominance were over, never to return.

But then Lebron came to the Lakers, and the Lakers had the assets to build a team around him. Remember Kawhi saying he wanted to be a Laker? It's what he said, there was a collective ""REEEEEEEE"" around the league. Jim Buss was gone, the Lakers had assets and were once again the premiere free agent destination in the league. This couldn't be allowed to happen, and it wasn't. You ever wonder why Kawhi looks so sad? It's cuz he wanted to be a Laker.

You ever give any thought to how the Lakers are covered? Jeanie is cheap! (she's not, she's paid plenty of tax and will do so in the future), Rob doesn't understand the cap! (he did, they were lying). There was no media coverage of Ballmer's colossal mismanagement of the LA market (Wings over Rings alienated the local fanbase). When you hear about the clippers on TNT. It's the same talking points over and over. Best roster in the league, best front office, best coach, best owner....with no enthusiasm, no emotion...it's like they are reading a paid advertisement, cuz well....they are.

So when you think why is the media banging the drum for the Lakers to trade their remaining assets? It's simple, it will keep them relevant this year (preserving clicks and revenue) and fuck their future. The dark spectre of 2025 free agency is on the horizon. If the Lakers have a good roster, a healthy AD (or someone else if he wants a trade) and cap space, get ready to hear another collective REEEEEE around the league.

We're actually not lacking wings, they're all just forced to play out position because Damian Jones is a 3rd-string big, Thomas Bryant is still injured, and FO didn't bring in anyone else


PG
 
- Our most stable position. 

- Beverley is still good for POA Defense who's unfortunately asked to guard mostly wings. Though anything on offense that he can provide is a bonus

- Westbrook finally finds his niche as our mini-LeBron 6th man. 

- Nunn has struggled and is the clear 3rd string. 

- Jury is out on Schroder but he's been consistently decent on both ends for years. Could be our starter when he returns, moving Pat Bev to SG

SG

- We have solid depth here, unfortunately they're all forced to play out of position due to our team structure

- Reaves is developing well as our new Caruso (albeit better on offense, worse on defense) but is tasked to do too much (from ball creation to playing out of position) due to lack of depth

- Walker has been a pleasant surprise, but like Reaves, has also been forced to play out of position due to our surplus of guards and lack of bigs

- Looking forward to seeing how Christie progresses. He's shown potential on defense

SF

- We actually have depth: A clear-cut star (LeBron), a solid backup (Troy Brown), and two third-string players (JTA and Ryan)

- Unfortunately, they all have to play PF

PF

- Nada. It should be AD, but he's forced to play C full time. Gabriel is a solid 10-15 minute player who's also forced to play C (too small). Swider's a two-way contract player

- Get a legit C and suddenly we'd have AD as our starter and Wenyen as a solid backup

C

- Nada. Damian Jones is a lot worse compared to his 2021 stint, where he didnt have to do much and was solid in spurts as a mini-JaVale. Now though? He's unplayable and is still treated as a 3rd string player despite the lack of big depth. Jury's out on Thomas Bryant but he didn't look good during the preseason.

* after fox made a fadeaway on reaves, im pretty sure troy brown looked at lebron and said something like 'when the f did he learn to do that' and put his hands up in confusion. lebron smiled and agreed
* lebron wasn't pressed or angry or frustrated at all. he just kind of sits like an elder statesman, observing. i think he knows not to waste mental energy and get too worked up, but he was either looking stoic or joking / smiling. almost like he's kinda checked out?
* russ doesn't sit on the bench when the game starts, he is in the tunnel warming up until a bit before he subs in but i know this was already known, was cool to see though
* russ talks to phil handy a lot when he gets subbed out. i couldn't tell if it was contentious or just passionate talk, but it's worth noting because i've seen it in other games too on tv and i've heard rumblings that russ doesn't really like handy
* anthony davis looks absolutely GASSED by the end of the game. he can't handle playing center. thomas bryant coming back could hopefully alleviate that but man. ad looks so slow and tired in person, especially in the second half. i know he was sick, but it was really noticeable. also sucks that d jones is so bad at center he isn't really an option for long-term minutes.

2205,2022-11-13 18:43:26,yua5v6,View on seats right behind the basket,Roaninho,"Hi team,
I will be able to view my first ever game next January (being from Germany it‚Äôs not easy).

I have found some decent seats for a hopefully good price, however, they are right behind the basket (107, G, seats 1+2). Will the view be obscured too much to really enjoy the game, especially on the seat next to the aisle? 

I only have time for one game and budget is sorta limited too. Other seats in the same price range are many many rows higher, so the question for me personally probably boils down to obscured view vs. further away. Any recommendations? Thanks!!",1.0
2206,2022-11-13 20:06:12,yucg84,Why does the thought of Bron taking a paycut this past summer to help this team blasphemous?,TorontoRaptors34,"I say this because Bron is a fuckin billionaire. Rob and Jeanie knew the Westbrook situation made it tough to attain role players for the squad. Ion see how its unfair to ask Bron if u really want to win help this team get better add 2-3 really good solid pieces like a real big and 3/D guys that would truly help this team out. 
Bron has a good relationship with PJ Tucker who played with Russ in Hous and is still fairly solid vet guy who played for Darvin Ham in Milwuake you don‚Äôt think if they had some money that he‚Äôd come to the Lakers over the Sixers. I just checked his contract and he has some security but I believe in Brons ability to get guys around the league. I think Draymond would prob play with Bron if he could lets be honest. PJ is 37 but still balls out in his role and is a champion. He can hit corner 3s as well as do the dirty work sorta what u want Melo‚Äôs role to be with defense. As well as Otto Porter Jr too. He‚Äôs a dynamic wing who can guard almost all positions just won a ring with GS and coulda helped AD huge as a FA. Bron signing an extension wasn‚Äôt wrong its just the amount of money. Maybe even Jamychal Green who signed with GS who can shoot and defend. Those 3 guys woulda been perfect even with the Center position being somewhat flimsy. 

I get that somethings are bigger than sports and that u want to get paid what ur worth. However, LeBron is 37 going on 38. So far this season he hasn‚Äôt looked like himself sure he can still put up numbers put they aren‚Äôt nearly as impactful. I also get he is LeBron James but this is also a team sport and guys like Tim Duncan took cuts all the time. James Harden just took a pay cut and umm its not that bright in Philly but still he made the effort.

Frankly AD should take a cut too given his injury but him being under contract makes it hard. WB i don‚Äôt blame given the uncertainty in his situation. There were rumors of him being out the league so why would he risk his career when he knew the drama surrounding the FO potentially wanting him gone. 
I do feel awful for Bron at this time and its a shame hes my favorite player of all time next to Kobe and Id hate to see him go out like this. But I do feel this past summer him taking a paycut woulda significantly helped the teams chances if he really wanted to win. Tbh he is worth a billion dollars off the court and continues to gain as we speak so i personally don‚Äôt see how him takin the cut would affect him personally. Maybe its jus the fan in me talking but I do feel its worth the ? And isn‚Äôt unfair to ask.",1.0

I think how Ham is getting AD the ball is terrible to be honest. He has him setting a million screens all game instead of letting him work in space from 16 feet and down and use his guard skills. Also they need to get him the ball on the post early in the clock like how the Sixers do for Embiid. To me it feels like they can do a better job at getting him open looks from the mid range.

2260,2022-11-14 07:14:14,yurr9q,"Great to See a W, But the Nets Missed a RIDICULOUS Amount of Open Shots",Trustthefundamentals,"**Positives From This Game:**  


* AD looked for his shot early and often against a team where that absolutely had to be the gameplan on offense
* AD and Westbrook only played about half of Westbrook's minutes together (more minute staggering between the two leads to better success and more floor spacing for AD to work)
* Reaves handled the ball on offense more, Westbrook less. ONLY 9 TURNOVERS largely due to this decision 
* Lakers shot 41% from three as a team, particularly great encouraging shooting from Lonnie
* Troy Brown Jr, Austin Reaves, and Lonnie Walker IV continue to play solid man on man defense.  Shoutout to Brown especially, who led the team with a +22 night on a team leading 36 minutes
* Gabriel's offensive post game continues to surprise. It looks like he's really starting to trust that very few people are going to block his 7'1"" wingspan

&amp;#x200B;

**Negatives From This Game:**  


* The semi blowout score is misleading. The Nets bricked open look after open look all night. If Darvin Ham is feeding the team praise for incredible defense, he's wrong. Sloppy rotations allowed multiple Nets to get open looks whenever they wanted. Sumner may have been the Lakers' MVP for the night. Off-night for KD, along with DNP's for Irving, Simmons, Curry (2nd, 3rd, &amp; 4th best players). Plus Claxton only played half the game before leaving
* 116 points for the Lakers looks great on paper, but 25 assists on 44 field goals is pretty meh. Still a lot of standing around from the supporting cast, and hoping AD hero balls them to a win, which he did this time. The Nets defense was paper thin as well, easily the worst the Lakers have faced
* Westbrook shot 4-15 with 4 turnovers. In all honesty, he could have had more like 7 turnovers. His highlights look great when he threads the needle with his passes, but the high risk/high reward decisions he makes are still detrimental to the Lakers' success. He continues to look more like last season's Russ after an encouraging sign that he was dialing back his gambley style for his first few games off the bench this season. His style of play and decisions continue, in my opinion, to prevent the Lakers from playing like at least a .500 team. Don't let a big dunk, surprising three, or occasional highlight pass fool you
* Nunn looked rough on an 0-4 night with none of his shots having a chance to go in. He still doesn't look fully healthy, based on how he's moving on the court and making half-hearted cuts",1.0

He plays the power forward and center positions. Davis is an eight-time NBA All-Star and has been named to four All-NBA First Teams and four NBA All-Defensive Teams. In his first season with the Lakers, he won an NBA championship in 2020. In 2021, he was named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team.[1]

Davis played one season of college basketball for the University of Kentucky, when he was first team All-American and the Consensus National Player of the Year. He also won the USBWA National Freshman of the Year, NABC Defensive Player of the Year and the Pete Newell Big Man Award. Davis led the NCAA in blocks and set Southeastern Conference and NCAA Division I freshman single-season blocked shots records. He led Kentucky to a national championship and was named the most outstanding player of the 2012 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament.

Davis left college for the NBA after one season and was drafted as the first overall pick in the 2012 NBA draft by the New Orleans Pelicans, known then as the New Orleans Hornets, and was selected that summer to play in the 2012 Olympics. After his rookie season, he was named to the NBA All-Rookie First Team. The next season, he became an All-Star for the first time and led the NBA in blocked shots per game. He has since become the youngest player to score at least 59 points in an NBA game. In 2017, he was named the recipient of the NBA All-Star Game MVP Award after setting an All-Star Game scoring record of 52 points. Davis was traded to the Lakers in 2019. He has won gold medals with the United States national team on their 2012 Olympic team and 2014 World Cup team, making him the first player in basketball history to win an NCAA title, NBA title, Olympic Gold Medal, and FIBA World Cup. üßõ

AD needs to be the clear number 1 option on offense. Ham has to convince Lebron to defer to AD when he's on the court.
2. Lebron needs to get back to his normal 23-25 PER All-NBA  team level performance that he's been since he's been a Lakers. 
3. Russ has to continue flourishing as the 6th man. 
4. Thomas Bryant has to be a playable center that can set screens, box out and battle for boards and be decent on defense. Thomas Bryant is an above average offensive center that can space the floor. If he can do that while doing the dirty work and being decent on defense he unlocks Anthony Davis being able to play the 4.

Another big, and a solid 3&amp;D wing would be nice. The Indiana trade is ok, but with Russ doing a solid job off the bench that gives the lakers another reason to not trade him, plus I would prefer to see Nunn and Damian Jones traded but what will that bring us in return?

One anonymous Western Conference executive says Rob Pelinka has been smart in being patient with the Lakers so far this season

‚ÄùSo here was the quote from the Western Conference executive I spoke to who had mentioned this. He says ‚ÄòWashington is the one that I keep thinking that‚Äôs going to happen. If you‚Äôre the Lakers, don‚Äôt you think you can get Bradley Beal? He‚Äôs got a no-trade clause, he wants to come to California‚Äô ‚Äî That was an interesting tidbit of this ‚Äî ‚ÄòHe essentially can pick where he wants to go (because of his no-trade clause) and the most the Lakers can really give is those two picks. But if he asks out and says California or bust, the Wizards, because of the no-trade clause, the Wizards do potentially have to take a lesser deal.‚Äô Like if you just put Bradley Beal on the block right now, open to the entire league, you‚Äôd get better than Westbrook plus the two picks. I think you‚Äôd get a better offer. Although maybe not. Bradley Beal‚Äôs contract is massive, maybe someone says ‚Äòhey we‚Äôre doing you a favor taking this huge contract off your hands for a guy who can‚Äôt carry a franchise. Is Westbrook and the two picks enough? Well, if Bradley Beal says ‚ÄòI only want to go to California or I only want to go to the Lakers because I have a no-trade clause and I can steer this thing... So that‚Äôs the logic that the Western Conference exec was laying out to me, and he said this: ‚ÄòWhatever you want to say about Pelinka, he‚Äôs being smart, he‚Äôs taking his time.‚Äô‚Äù

What I‚Äôm about to say is gonna take some logic and common sense to understand, so I already know that isn‚Äôt going to go well in this sub. 

But let‚Äôs face facts. No move we make is going to make us a contender. We are a bad to mediocre team, that can at best be a solid mediocre team making any of the trades that are constantly whined about here. So flush more picks down the drain for a possible 2nd round sweep? Great idea. 

I‚Äôm pretty sure our front office knows this despite what all the big brains in this sub think. What is happening right now though is that Russ is on an upward trajectory and redemption arc, and everyone loves a redemption story. 

What is realistic is that Russ keeps playing himself into a elite role player that will make him a hot commodity come trade deadline and then he can be flipped to a contender for actual value that will actually benefit this franchise and it‚Äôs future, and not cost us future picks we need. I know the Bronsexuals hate to hear it, but this is what‚Äôs good for the franchise, not Bron.  Hell, I don‚Äôt even think Bron really cares as much at this point anyway, at least based on his attitude. I think he‚Äôs happy playing and living in LA, chasing Kareem, watching his kids ball.",1.0

Warriors: currently 6-8 with no defence and no bench.

Clippers: the Kawhi situation is completely up in the air and no guarantee that he can play meaningful minutes.

Nuggets: they are good, MPJ has the usual health concerns, but I expect the team to trend upwards. Nuggets currently looking like one of the tougher outs.

Phoenix: similar to last year, a deep well coached team. However, can CP3 do it in the playoffs, will they collapse again?

Grizz: they are a good team, but against an improved Lakers squad, are they insurmountable? I don‚Äôt think so.

Pelicans: a good but youthful squad that hasn‚Äôt made any noise in the playoffs.

Utah and Portland: both of these teams are unlikely to keep up their current trajectory, and aren‚Äôt that scary in a 7 game series.

My point, all of the preseason ‚ÄúContenders‚Äù are looking vulnerable. No team is out of reach. With a trade, the Lakers can make some serious noise in the playoffs.

If the thinking is that LeBron or AD can‚Äôt stay healthy enough to make it work? Fuck a WB trade, blow the whole thing up.

The Clippers aren‚Äôt going anywhere with Kawhi injured, Chris Paul looks like he‚Äôs now washed, and the Warriors hopes with Poole, Klay, and the young guys are all but over. Dallas only had one true superstar, Pelicans need more seasoning, and Timberwolves aren‚Äôt going anywhere.

Stop this nonsense about AD and Lebron is old, no, that's not true at all, Lebron is still very quick and agile, still to this day, no one can stop him from going to the basket at will, that's not a guy who is old, his shooting will return as he continues to find his last season's shooting form, and when that time comes, he will score 30-40 again as easy as hot knife going through butter like last season. As for AD, no need to explain more as you saw from your very eyes that he's already on his way to returning to the monster AD form.

When you have Lebron and AD, you are always, always one or two moves away from changing the fate of your franchise.

The problem with this team is that there are no elite shooters, which slows down Lebron and AD cause the paint is so clogged. Period. 

I‚Äôve heard people say that Lebron stymies the talent of other players(citing Bosh and Kevin Love as examples). Do people not realize that it‚Äôs literally fucking impossible for 3 ball dominant superstars to function at max potential when they‚Äôre all on the same team? Bosh and Love took a step back because they were the worst of the 3 superstars on those teams. It had nothing to do with Bron making them worse as players. It‚Äôs about doing a job for a team to maximize the potential of the team, which they did. And I never get why people complain about Love and Bosh‚Äôs roles‚Ä¶they literally put up good numbers and won multiple championships with Lebron. 

Also, It‚Äôs a myth that Lebron can‚Äôt play off ball. His catch and shoot 3 pt stats last year were on par with Tatum, Middleton, and Lowry in terms of volume and %. Plus he‚Äôs excellent at cutting and he can do PNR. 

I do agree that Lebron needs to cut down on stalling the ball in the half court when he returns. But he was only doing that cause other guys were shitting the bed when it came to creating their own shot. The supporting cast is finding their way now, but it was not that way earlier in the season and it‚Äôs not like Bron wasn‚Äôt giving them the oppportunity to showcase their talents as they‚Äôve done the past couple games. The supporting cast simply wasn‚Äôt executing.

Not only are y‚Äôall showing your bias and frankly shitty fan hood of a team (rooting on the leaders downfall), y‚Äôall are also showing your inability to use context in your argument. ‚ÄúHis isolation scoring wasn‚Äôt as efficient as it could‚Äôve been last year‚Äù newsflash guys, the team sucked last year and when that‚Äôs the case, efficiency numbers go down.

2551,2022-11-20 06:59:47,yzxlg8,How do you guys feel about a move for Alec Burks?,TorontoRaptors34,"I think a small pick up like Alex Burks can be a really solid deal for this team. 
I think a Bev/Nunn for Burks deal would be fairly solid. I would like to think theres a way to acquire him without getting rid of Bev but regardless it makes the most sense.

U replace a vet for a vet. Detroit can get Bev to really help give some toughness and direction for the young guys in Detroit like he did for Minnesota or trade Bev again to another team. 

Burks would be a solid pick up because 
- He 6‚Äù6 gives u solid size on the wing and the perimeter
- Can SHOOT THE BALL! He‚Äôs a guy who can help take some load off the wings on this team like Troy especially and can even play the point at times as a luxury. 
- He's not too old he 31 and he has a fair amount of experience in the league. 

I think this is the best minimal move than can help light this team give it a bit clarity. 
This way u have direct guard and wing rotations that can be fairly switchable. To me there is no such thing as a crowded wing rotation youd much rather have a wing squad than a guard one. If u start him at the point u can have some nice spacing and it gives more energy for a guy like Troy Brown who the teams very reliant on as a wing.
I like Bev and maybe theres a way where u can do this without giving him up but personally I think the best way to keep a dynamic while making a move is trade Bev for Burks straight up. I feel Burks versatility will allow u to do more with either the starters or the bench squad. 

PS(off topic) Ham needs to bench Nunn for good and replace him with Ryan full time.",1.0

We're 29th in the league in points given up in the 3rd at 30.7 only Minnesota is worse at 31.8 but they're 20th in points scored per 3rd themselves so it's not as detrimental.

Every game the themes are the 1st 5 and final 2 minutes of the 3rd quarter. We're either up at the half and the team erases that deficit within minutes like the Cavs game. We're tied at the half and the opposing team pushes the lead to 8-10 points within minutes like the Clippers game the other day.

The same problem for the past 2 seasons my only conclusions are AD and LeBron loses focus to start the 2nd half and are just coming out flat and the defensive edge isn't there. We're not coming out of the half and establishing AD off the bat like we do to start games.",0.91

2019/2020 - 26/9/3/ and 2 blks on 50/33/84 splits

This season - 25/12/3 with 2 blks on 55/23/80 splits 

So as you can see, his stats look almost
identical except one glaring difference. He shot 33% from 3 on about 2.5 attemps a game, compared to only 23% on 1 attemp this season. 

The last couple seasons, both his free throw - and three point percentage had been on a steady decline, but sa far throughout his first 14 games, AD is hitting his free throws at a once again consistent rate. However, the same thing cannot be said for his 3pt shooting unfortunately. 

Now we can only hope that his three point shot will come around again, but AD has been playing really great in almost every other way. 

Aside from the mentioned free throw shooting, he‚Äôs actually shooting a career high 57% from 2. Not only is he dominating in the paint, but he‚Äôs actually been somewhat effective in the short midrange, knocking down a career high 54% of his shots from 3-10 feet. 

Aside from the shooting, he‚Äôs also been dominating on the boards, averaging 11.5 boards which is great considering he‚Äôs never even averaged over 10 since coming to LA. 

Lastly, I just wanna point out how many of AD‚Äôs buckets are ‚Äúself made‚Äù. Only 42% of AD‚Äôs buckets have been assisted this season which is really low for a big man. Looking at his career averages of 66%, we can clearly see that this is incredibly low. This is most likely largely due to Lebron missing some games, but it‚Äôs great to see AD just be able to iso or post up his defender to score without needing to be constantly set up for easy baskets. 

Obviously, we also cannot forget his defense as he‚Äôs once again absolutely dominating on that end as well.

I thought these ‚ÄúLeBron is the problem‚Äù takes were just jokes. Then I started seeing some ‚ÄúLeBron needs to change his game‚Äù takes. What exactly do people want him to change? Do people even watch basketball? Is it that people just don‚Äôt understand what they are watching? Some people truly believe LeBron still consistently uses up possessions/shot clock at Luka levels.

[These are all of the Lakers possessions in the 1ST and 4TH quarters of the Clippers game (the last game he played), with LeBron on the floor.](https://streamable.com/4xky77)


Watching these possessions, what exactly was LeBron doing that would prevent AD from being AD? There are simple explanations for why AD and the Lakers have looked good lately:

1. No LeBron, more possessions for AD.
2. AD has been more aggressive.
3. Lakers had four days without a game and used that time to watch film, practice and clean up some stuff. You can see their DHOs have improved (not great but better). Nothing more annoying than when teams run DHOs and the guy getting the hand-off stops and allows his defender to get back in front of him. You just defeated the whole purpose of a DHO and took some time off your shot clock, making the offense look even more stagnant.
4. The competition they‚Äôve faced.

Yes, LeBron is going to use up some clock in these situations: 

1. On post ups.
2. When he gets a switch on a big guy, he‚Äôll take his sweet time and go for a step back three or a drive. https://streamable.com/gq0ft2
3. When he gets switched onto a little guy, he‚Äôll take his time and back him down.

In all three of the above situations, if he misses the shot or turns the ball over, it looks really bad (as a lot of time comes off the shot clock, oftentimes with teammates standing around watching). Somebody like MITWestBrook would clip that and use it as ‚Äúevidence‚Äù for why LeBron slows down the offense. I remember reading one of the comments on one of his posts and someone said something in the vein of ‚Äúhow is he wrong if he is providing video proof?‚Äù You can clip videos and pick stats to tell whatever story you wanna tell, especially with a small sample size. You gotta at least watch whole quarters or stretches, to critique someone's playstyle. Anyone who has been watching the Lakers can tell LeBron has been offball plenty and has been getting rid of the ball quickly. I actually would like him to run more pick n rolls. I don‚Äôt like when he just stands in the perimeter and throw passes, which he‚Äôs been doing a lot.

In sum, he is not slowing down the offense. He has just been awful. His FG, FT and 3PT averages are currently below his career average. Yes, in certain situations like the ones I outlined above (and important stretches, like end of quarter, to stop a run or to close a game), he is going to hold the ball. Making the right decisions in those situations is one of the things he does best. Again, he has just been awful so far. Acting like he just routinely stops the flow of this offense just does not jive with the film. There are legit criticisms for LeBron, there‚Äôs no need to just make shit up. LeBron cuts, often when he is in the corner. If he cuts and doesn‚Äôt get the ball, he will put his head down. If he seals his man in the paint and doesn‚Äôt get the ball https://streamable.com/s0qhwf, he‚Äôll put his head down and might take time getting back on defense.",0.87

The framework of the trade is still solid...Pincus just didnt have the right point guard in mind...how about instead of the Lakers-Pistons-Nets...the real 3-team deal would be Lakers-Pistons-Hornets...the deal would still involve the 27 &amp; 29 picks but instead of targeting Kyrie... Lakers would get Terry Rozier instead...Rozier is already signed long term so no need to worry about resigning him in the off-season...Rozier fits perfectly with Lebron &amp; AD to complete a better big 3 @ half the salary of what Kyrie or Bradley Beal would cost the Lakers to acquire...

the way I would structure the deal is a 4 for 4 trade...Lakers give up their 4 worst contracts and pickup 4 players that will fill all the holes in the roster...

Lakers get: Terry Rozier, Bojan Bogdanovic, Mason Plumlee, Alex Burks...

Hornets get: 27' 1st, Pat Bev, Nunn, Nerlens Noel [from pistons]

Pistons get: 29' 1st, Westbrook, Damion Jones...

they great thing about this trade is every team has major incentives to make a deal...Hornets and Pistons are already in the Wemby sweepstakes as the two worst teams in the east...both teams have incentives to start shedding long term salary and veteran contracts immediately...Terry Rozier is year 1 of a four year deal which means a team would have to commit long term cap space to acquire him plus give draft compensation... How many contending teams are willing to do that for 6'2 point guard??... Bogdanovic just signed an extension...Pistons are going nowhere so any team willing to offer a 1st Rd. Pick could easily acquire him... Burks and Plumlee are good veteran players on expiring deals...Lakers could maybe throw in a 2nd Rd. picks to grease the deal... 

no waiting on teams to turn direction and decide to blow up the season...waiting for star players to demand to be traded to the Lakers...all that is just wild speculation that is not likely to happen anytime soon...this trade can be completed anytime after Dec. 15th...

this proposed trade gives the Lakers roster everything its missing...size to complement AD... perimeter shooting...big wing...bench depth...Terry Rozier is the perfect #3 to compliment Lebron &amp; AD...he would excel as the point guard flanked by those two mega stars...the same time you shed all the bloated contracts and dead weight holding this squad back from being a contender...this is the deal Rob Pelinka should be pursuing yesterday with teams that have incentive to work with the Lakers to get a deal done...

oh did I mention that this deal would net the Lakers 7.5 million in total roster salary savings...saving Jeanie Buss over 30 MILLION in luxury taxes...WHAT THE HELL IS PELINKA WAITING FOR...you see my handle dammit...",1.0

He‚Äôs also been a monster on the boards, grabbing some that look way out of reach. Seeing as rebounding is consistently an underrated issue with our team, this is huge. Most importantly, however, is the fact that he allows AD to get some time at the 4, where he‚Äôs known to dominate.

They seemed to have solved the issue of Lebron and Russ‚Äôs fit temporarily for it to backfire with Bron straining his adductor and groin again

This means Bron shouldn‚Äôt focus on driving and doing anything to strain it further until it fully heals. The issue is that on a guard dominant roster only Bron, Reaves, and Russ have shown playmaking potential

The positives of reaves are that he can create his own shot and create for others but more or less on a secondary playmaker level. He is more likely to be attacked and turn it over without Bron or Russ sharing minutes with him to distribute the ball. 

Nunn has proven more of being a 2 guard who should focus primarily on spot up shooting or self creation. 

Beverly has really struggled offensively personally and creating offense for others. At the very best you could call him a defensive specialist. 

Schroeders self creation has looked good but the offense has looked very dry in his minutes. 

The offense has really shined under Russ especially in the past three games with Bryant returning. He has really carved out a role for wenyen, Bryant, and created great chemistry with AD and others. 

Interestingly enough his assist to turnover ratio has been 3:1 in this stretch and for the first time in forever finished his first game as Ham has been very adamant about reeling him in when he tends to do too much leading to turnovers or mistakes which is a great stride in him carving out his role and getting over the terrible start to the season and what was last season. 

If Russ can produce and produce efficiently, and we keep Bron healthy with injury prevention in mind we have the ability to make some sort of run until Bron becomes healthy again. The lakers don‚Äôt have to trade both picks but they should use one to get off bev and nunn for upgrades whether at the wing or center position. 

Fan base needs to stop the whole stan thing and think collectively which I‚Äôm sure is the plan Ham will employ anyways",1.0

However, I will always go for size any day. Kendrick Nunn is a small guard who can't defend either and has had a string of 0 point games. Matt Ryan is also responsible for one of this teams wins. Nunn I understand is coming off an injury riddled season but the team has looked better without him. Not to mention Dennis imo if u give him all Nunn's mins I feel he will look far superior. U also got Beverly. All these guys are essentially the same size so why play them all together. 

Matt Ryan to me has a very short leash. He is a shooter on a team thats been criticized for its poor shooting. Why not give him and Dennis all of Nunn's mins. You don't need to give Matt 30 mins but 10-13 wouldn't be bad. He plays with confidence and can give u a few 3s a game which is well needed. On defense he not the best but can at least serve as a decoy thanks to his size, while Nunn can't guard a fly. 

Not to mention as far as pg's u got Russ whos making many guys around him better and embracing that 6th man role perfectly. Then u got Reaves who is really stepping up to the plate with that role making smart choices as well as being able to disguise himself as a 2 or 3 as well. He's also been proven to shine in a bigger role. Lonnie is also solid with the ball in his hands too. Then u have Bron need I say more. Kendrick Nunn is very redundant and is not showing up. Even when he shoots it just looks accidental if it goes in and has only looked good in garbage time. To me Nunn and Jones have to replaced asap. 

To me I believe Reaves should be a starting pg. Bev should also come otb. Dennis should be there kinda as maybe a starter or maybe just a luxury given how Russ is been playing as a 6th man. Nunn shouldn't see any mins.",1.0

2731,2022-11-23 05:59:57,z2h12r,Lakers Observations,jaychilled,"(TLDR at bottom)
Finally faced a really good team during the win streak and am happy to say this team can compete with the best of them but just wanna see if anybody agrees with what I think are negatives , positives and easy adjustments from this past stretch of games

Negatives

Shot making 

 to me that really stand out are open shot making and lineups. This team has to play almost perfect to stay in a game because the perimeter shooting is so awful while almost every other team takes and makes a variety of shots, contested or not while lakers aren‚Äôt consistent enough on wide open jumpers 
 
Lineups

hams lineups are reaching Vogel levels of bad, Schroeder, Westbrook, nunn and pat bev / lonnie lineups with like Bryant at the 5, Schroeder is always paired with Westbrook , brown/Lonnie is taken out the game before Beverly always. I think nunn is worthless , Beverly is close to that and shroeder needs more time but he has offered nothing(maybe due with who‚Äôs beside him ) but still.  
It‚Äôs bothered me more than anything because the offense isn‚Äôt good enough to gift the other team 2-5 minutes of bad basketball

Positives 

Players are stepping up, AD is playing like the best player on the team, and not this suns game but perimeter players have been making shots finally. And even when they weren‚Äôt making shots they still were hanging wit the suns

Westbrook hitting shots , creating offense and playing defense like he does is really helpful 

Austin reaves being comfortable hitting jumpers off the pnr, spot up and jus being more aggressive is nice 

Etc 
I think nunn and pat bev need to see severe minute restriction , max christie should take nunns minutes completely. 

TLDR , I never felt this team was as hopeless as last season even with this bad roster construction and they are proving why. Extremely fixable issues and this team margin for error is small if they continue to be bad from the perimeter . AD is the ultimate band aid especially if he plays at that level",1.0

I have found myself even skipping lunch at work to use the money for gas instead. Overall it has not been a championship season for us. But we are happy and chipping away at it. My wife however has grown restless, she is a stay at home mom at the moment and recently decided she wanted to chip in and help. I encouraged her to pursue her dream of starting a business and with my last $150 I bought a domain, built a [square space site](www.moneymombrand.com) and helped her manufacture 8 shirts from her original design.

2754,2022-11-23 08:29:17,z2jp8i,Buddy Hield and Myles Turner are not what this team needs.,BrianC_,"People need to take a realistic look at this team right now.

With AD dominating, TB looking much better since returning, and Wenyen being a capable hustle player, they have 48 minutes of solid center production.

With LeBron returning and being predominantly a 4 these days, that's a lot of your 4/5 minutes covered.

With Reaves and Walker IV playing exceptionally well, they have the role of SG covered.  Splitting 48 minutes of 2-guard production between them with a bit of spillover to the 3 is fine.  Even if you need 3pt shooting volume, it shouldn't come at their expense.

Those parts of the team are fine.

Where are the holes on this team?

With the way Beverley is playing on offense, he's nearing the point of being unplayable yet covers almost 30 mpg.

If the team trades Westbrook, with Nunn and Schroder playing the way they are and no reasonable expectation they'll change drastically, they'll need a bench play-maker that can lead and stabilize the 2nd unit.

While TBJ has been good for a minimum level player, it's very clear that with LeBron being predominantly a 4 these days that they need more quality and depth at the 3.

Because Reaves and Walker IV are fine at the 2 and Beverley is so painfully under-performing, it's quite obvious that the team needs a volume 3pt shooting PG with at least neutral PoA defense.

And, because the team's center rotation is fine, LeBron is predominantly a 4, and TBJ, while good as a minimum, isn't enough at the 3, they need a 3/4 combo forward that is a volume 3pt shooter and capable perimeter defender.

Lastly, if the team trades Westbrook to get those pieces, they'll also need a quality back-up play-maker to lead the 2nd unit.  If the team is left with Nunn and Schroder as their 2nd-unit play-makers, that's a disaster.

Do Turner and Hield fill those needs?

Hield straight up does not.  He fills a need in terms of shooting but doesn't fill the team's needs defensively or in terms of play-making (even though I do think Hield is an underrated play-maker, he's at best a secondary one).

Turner addresses some issues by pushing AD to the 4 and LeBron to the 3 thus sizing up and lessening the need for SF minutes.  But, while AD might be more comfortable as a mobile big on defense, LeBron is not as a wing-stopper nor should he have to expend that type of energy defensively while still needing to excel on offense.  The team is still left very thin in terms of wing 3pt shooting and defense and Turner doesn't really fix that.

Overall, there would still be major holes on this team even after such a trade.  Would they be better?  Probably.  Would they be a contender?  I'm not sure.

Now, is there a trade currently out there that actually directly fills all the needs we have?  No.  Not that I've seen.

But, is there a need to rush into an imperfect trade?  No.  This is their only chance at getting it right and if they want to contend, they have to.  If this team cannot stay afloat without Hield and Turner, there is no point to having them.",0.38
2755,2022-11-23 09:15:33,z2kfpd,AD should force Pelinka‚Äôs hand,ThunderClown101,"Why can‚Äôt he just give an ultimatum to Rob? 

‚ÄúImprove the team drastically before Christmas or I will request a trade‚Äù

AD is playing like the modern day Wilt, LeBron is the best 38 year old player ever and is a top 15 player in the league. 

There are trades that can improve this team and capitalize on this goated duo. 

I think AD should force Pelinka to make the trade. 

A starting lineup of Walker IV, Hield, Bron, AD and Turner can run with anyone in the league. It‚Äôs a crazy offensive lineup with 2 solid rim protectors. 

Trade Nunn, Pat Bev along with 2 rounders for a quality rotation player and you got a nice bench of Reaves, TBJ, Bryant, Shroeder and Josh Richardson for example. 

This team can compete for the 3-4th spot in the West and this is enough for LBJ and AD to make a deep playoff run. 

Who are we scared of with the new squad?

Suns pee their bad every year in the playoffs unless their opponent gets an injury. 

Mavericks are not really a threat, Warriors are struggling. 

Blazers, Nuggets or Clippers? 

These teams have proven that they can‚Äôt win when it matters and Dame and Kawhi are always unavailable. 

There is a window this year and we got 2 superstars.",0.43

Lakers would get Terry Rozier who is already signed for long term so no need to worry about resigning him in the off-season...Rozier fits perfectly alongside Lebron &amp; AD as an explosive scoring guard similar to Kyrie or Bradley Beal but better defender... @ half the salary of what Kyrie or Bradley Beal would demand for long term commitment... Bogdanovic is also signed under contract for multiples years...these two guys are high level starters who would not be half season rentals like a Myles Turner could possibly be...or on a bloated contract like Buddy Hield...the way I would structure the deal is a 4 for 4 trade...Lakers give up their 4 worst contracts and pickup 4 players that will fill all the holes in the roster...

Lakers get: Terry Rozier, Bojan Bogdanovic, Mason Plumlee, Alec Burks...

Hornets get: 27' 1st, Pat Bev, Nunn, Nerlens Noel [from pistons]

Pistons get: 29' 1st, Westbrook, Damion Jones...

they great thing about this trade is every team has major incentives to make a deal happen...Hornets and Pistons are already out of playoff contention and are looking to position themselves favorably for the Wembanyama sweepstakes...both teams have incentives to start shedding long term salary and veteran contracts for future draft picks...Terry Rozier is on year 1 of his 4 year extension... which means a team would have to commit long term cap space to acquire him plus give up draft compensation... that is alot of commitment to give for a 6'2 guard...how many contending teams are willing to do that... Bogdanovic just signed an extension...Pistons are going nowhere and are building for the future...so any team willing to offer a 1st Rd. Pick could easily acquire him... Burks and Plumlee are very good veteran players on expiring deals...Lakers could maybe throw in a few 2nd Rd. picks to acquire those two in the deal as well... no waiting on mystery ""superstars"" to suddenly demand to be traded to the Lakers...no need for wild speculation or conspiracy trade theories from anonymous GMs...we are talking very talented veterans from teams who are already tanking... 4 players that transform this team to true contenders...maybe title favorites...best part is this trade proposal can be completed after Dec. 15th...3 weeks away...this proposed trade gives the Lakers roster everything its missing...size to complement AD...  dynamic perimeter  scoring/shooting...big wing players...bench depth...Terry Rozier is the perfect #3 to compliment Lebron &amp; AD...he would excel as the lead guard flanked by two mega stars...I would even give Rozier Westbrook's #0 jersey...the new &amp; improved 360 trio... 

importing this level of talent while at the same time you shed all the bloated contracts and dead weight holding this roster back from being what it could be...this is the deal Rob Pelinka should be pursuing...Pistons-Hornets would have tangible incentive to work with the Lakers to get a deal done...did I mention that this deal would cut 7.5 million off the top of the Lakers total payroll ...saving Jeanie Buss over 30 MILLION in luxury taxes...WHAT THE HELL IS PELINKA WAITING FOR...#makethetradepelinka",1.0

It's been a down year for our boys in purple and gold and it's been a down couple of years for me and my wife as well. Recently we have experienced a host of economic issues and most days we are tasked with making difficult decisions about what bills to pay and what bills to not pay. I have found myself even skipping lunch at work to use the money for gas instead. Overall it has not been a championship season for us. But we are happy and chipping away at it. My wife however has grown restless, she is a stay at home mom at the moment and recently decided she wanted to chip in and help. I encouraged her to pursue her dream of starting a business and with my last $150 I bought a domain, built a [squarespace](www.moneymombrand.com) site and helped her manufacture 8 shirts from her original design. They look nice and the site is live! I am very proud of her for not only wanting to pursue her dream but also because it's coming from a place of support. She wants to help our situation and frankly I couldn't be more in love with her.

I am hoping this is allowed but maybe the Lakers nation can rise up and give our Instagram a follow? Check out the site and give us some feedback? Either way I hope our season turns around and maybe in a couple of months our lives will turn around too.

2865,2022-11-25 04:05:48,z43eeo,Our only current rivals are the Celtics,LALakers4Lyf,"Tldr: This is because we sucked from 2014-2018, so our rivalries with most teams (except those green shits) died. Whatever other ""rivalry"" we have is really a rival of LeBron himself, unsurprising since he made 9 Finals trips in 10 years

We're tied with Boston for 17 championships, with even more additional fuel tossed in there with Cs fans discrediting our 5 Minneapolis Championships while Laker fans retort with the 11 titles won during an era of 8 teams. Even more with LeBron having his own history against Boston since 2008

Apart from that, there's no one else.

Spurs - There's nobody left from the 2000s rivalry + we took a deep dive to the bottom after 2013 while the Spurs remained contenders/playoff teams, effectively ending the rivalry

Warriors - The only one who has a rivalry with GS is LeBron. We sucked during the GS dynasty, they sucked during our championship season, we reversed roles again in 2022, and the 2021 Play In was more LeBron vs Curry

Suns - We live rent free in their heads, and can you blame them? Since the Kobe era, despite beating us in the playoffs 3 times (2006, 2007, 2021), they never won the championship. The two times we beat them (2000, 2010) led to 2 championships, with 2010 being Nash's last playoff run with the Suns. Recently, it's just the LeBron and Laker tax. If anything, they should thank us for getting them the pick that became Mikhail Bridges

Kings - ""The Kings weren't our rivals. They never beat us. The Spurs are our rivals"" - Kobe during the late 2000s

Clippers - They're just trying to reestablish themselves in LA since Sterling was forced out and Balmer bought the team, and what faster way to gain publicity than to pick a fight with the Lakers. In 2020, there was a case to be made because they got the two stars who were linked to us for years (Kawhi and PG), who also happened to view LeBron as a huge rival. Now though? Both teams have been too injured to resume the intensity of the 2020 matchups",1.0

2877,2022-11-25 22:25:45,z4q5l5,Funny how celtics are public enemies of lakers and Lebron before he came here,junahn,"Lakers-Celtics rivalry was always a thing but Lebron and Celtics rivalry was crazy too.

Despite the pistons and spurs who were the unanimous top dogs against the cavs in 2006 and 2007, Celtics during big three era and Lebron was always a close series.

2008 was one of those peak years of Lebron who was just one man army and his other teammates were embarrassments. 

2010 series was the crucial point which made Lebron go to Miami and form big three with wade and Bosh.

2011, Lebron demolished them in 5 games, and 2012 the legendary game 6 happened.

Surprisingly, after big three ended, Celtics kept face Lebron in playoffs, like in 2015 and 2017 when Isiah Thomas was balling. 

And Kyrie went to the celtics and betrayed Lebron, and celtics faced Lebron again in 2018 and it was a battle of 7 games series. 

Btw Lebron averaged 28.8 points 7.2 rebounds and 7.0 assists in 56 games versus the Celtics in his career. Which is almost highest among his stats against every other team  


As lebron fan, even though media said Warriors was Lebron's biggest enemy, I still think celtics was Lebron's worst enemy. Probably spurs after that.",1.0

I believe lebron was grown in a test tube and then artificially implanted into Gloria James and carried to term. no human being should possess his combination of size, strength and athleticism. AND to book it all out, he's very intelligent too. (besides the decision) remember how much poise he had just coming into the league at 18 years old? it's un-natural. how often have TV analysts described him as a ""freak of nature"" .....maybe it's truer than we know.

I am serious. we all know (and I swear I am not saying this to be insulting or mean) that lebron's mom was a crack whore (is drug addicted prostitute better?) it's just a fact, it happened. I am NOT saying this to be mean, in fact I am a heroin addict and know a few woman who have sold themselves for dope, it happens. they are not bad people.

and the government has a history of using prostitutes and impoverished people in ""experiments."" read about MK-ULTRA. it happened. the CIA used to have prostitutes slip LSD to johns and then the agents would watch what happened thru 2-way mirrors. the government helped start and continue the crack epidemic of the 80s.

I believe that lebron was a precursor experiment to create super soldiers. something where they were just like ""well let's test it out on some poor people that no one will notice and see if we can get any results before we sink more billions into this.""

it's not all that crazy. you don't think the government has interest in creating genetically modified super human soldiers? we know for a FACT it does. it's been documented. you don't think russia or china has interest in such a thing? you know they do. and anything russia or china is or would be doing we are doing. to do it first and do it better.

he's some kind of experiment that they just monitored from a distance and let keep growing. and i mean this was probably initially started with just a few people who believed it could be done and that's why it started small and covert using regular civilians. until they could show the results to the higher ups and say ""look at this, you don't wanna fund this on a larger scale?""

and where else would such a person end up besides in a professional sports league?

I think there is probably some secret base(s) out there that are now filled with people like lebron, younger than him probably. if they couldn't see how well the experiment worked until he was about 16-18 years old (he was pretty much a full grown man at 16 and could have came off the bench for any NBA team if not started) than maybe there are a bunch of 9-15 year old super humans like lebron (not copies of him but given the same genetic boost that he was) eating chow in some secret barracks right now.....

until someone comes forth and the DNA test shows him to be his father (and a bunch have come forward and been shown not to be) than I will believe this is AT LEAST possible..",1.0

However AD is playing at an MVP level and LeBron continues to look strong. Lots of championship level role players like Reaves and Walker.

And with an easy schedule coming up we ""should"" be around .500 ball by mid December or whenever the 20th extension of this was.

So what happens from here? Pelinka cares more about his job security than actually helping this year's team contend for a championship. The Hield Turner offer we SHOULD have accepted in the offseason has undoubtedly gone up since then. Any other trade Pelinka will get heavily scrutinized for AND if he even makes the Hield/Turner trade now people will complain and bitch that he could have done before the season and saved us 10+ losses.

I will be stunned if he actually makes a move involving any FRP's. Those are his last lifeline to not getting fired and sadly he is a selfish man. What do you think?",1.0

""If it feels like you‚Äôre being gaslighted by Rob Pelinka, well, you‚Äôre not the only one. This would be the third deadline and second postponement of a deadline to start the season.

First, it was the 20-game mark that would serve as a large enough sample size before making a deal. Then it was Dec. 15, the date that players signed in the off-season can be dealt. Both of those dates have some logic based in them.

This newest deadline? Ehhhhh. This is when it‚Äôs starting to feel like the Lakers are just looking for reasons to not work out a trade. Look, there may not be a lot of deals available right now on the trade market, which would be fine. But nobody asked for these deadlines and offering them up only to basically ignore them when they arrive is silly.""",1.0

That‚Äôs great in the first half. But when adjustments are made at half time such as doubling or tripling LeBron/AD or clogging the paint - this team will struggle. If it‚Äôs a close game in the final minutes like today or against Portland? We will struggle to score and get quality looks.

The reason why is our half court offense is near the bottom of the league because we didn‚Äôt sign or trade for any shooters who teams can‚Äôt cheat off. Bonafide shooters get plays made for them. 

When you have LeBron and AD and no real shooters teams respect, your only game plan in a tight ball game is to rely on LeBron and AD to make something happen even though the defense will solely be focused on them because no one else is a perimeter threat.

Then we have the issue of lack of wing defenders. You know people who can slow down a team from making a comeback when you‚Äôre up 17 late in a game. 

There will be more games this year that will follow this exact timeline:

Lakers look dominant in the first half -&gt; teams make an adjustment at the half -&gt; thus leading to the ‚Äúthird quarter lakers‚Äù -&gt; teams with shooters hit shots -&gt; lakers defense and lack of shooting can‚Äôt keep up in a shootout -&gt; one possession game lakers become reliant on their two stars -&gt; teams focus on them. 

This season was cooked before our first preseason game because the front office doesn‚Äôt want to build a modern NBA roster that requires shooting and wing depth.

I honestly don‚Äôt know how a group of Pro NBA player find it so hard to just make an extra open look or two every game.

I've got enough. Lebron James just isn‚Äôt a good player anymore.

I mean look at this on off stats: if Lebron is on the court, the Lakers score 107 points per 100 possessions. If he's off the court, they score 112. 

On the other hand, you can clearly see that Lebron is getting old. But he isn‚Äôt just a bit less jumpy, he can‚Äôt even drill threes as he did last season. His efficiency has never been so bad since his rookie season.

That's ridiculous. Everyone's talking about Lebron‚Äôs bad defence (our opponents score 112 points when he‚Äôs on the court and 110 if he isn‚Äôt), but his offence isn‚Äôt better. 

And you can't tell me that's just because he is in the starting line-up, so he just plays the good players of the opposing teams. 

Just look at the offensive rating with Anthony Davis! on court 113 points, off court 103. It‚Äôs the same with Westbrook, on court 114, off court 104.

In other words: Lebron is MINUS 5.5 when he is on the Court and PLUS 7.5 when he is off the court. And this is your franchise player????

And in my opinion, we see that also in games, so it isn‚Äôt just a stat-myth. An example would be our last game against the Pacers. Look at Lebron in the CRUNCHTIME! The Pacers drained three after three and Lebron defended like James Harden in an elimination game. He just went after the Rebounds, like Westbrook. 

I‚Äôll tell you the truth: we aren‚Äôt going to win a championship along as Lebron is our franchise player (and if he is the second man behind AD).",1.0

I‚Äôm a huge Bron stan, but if you watch these games, it‚Äôs obvious. He jacks terrible 3s, runs post isos and shoots awful fadeaways, doesn‚Äôt get back on defense, and commits terrible turnovers.

Is LeBron washed? Hell no. On the contrary, I think he can still get 20-25 points and play at an all star level. But he‚Äôs no longer good enough to be a true #1 guy, and guess what, that‚Äôs okay. He‚Äôs almost 40 years old, it‚Äôs been time for him to take a step back. Idk if its Steph getting his 4th or Kareem‚Äôs record, but this is the most selfish version of LeBron I‚Äôve ever seen. In the 19-20 season, he played PG and made sure AD got the ball. Now its 3 years later and for some reason LeBron seems hellbent on proving that he‚Äôs still ‚Äúthe guy‚Äù.

I‚Äôm not putting any blame on AD for ‚Äúbeing passive‚Äù in the 4th. It‚Äôs on LeBron to be a fucking leader and get him the ball. Austin should be doing more ballhandling with Bron as a screener. Bron can get his 20-25 as more of a finisher. No need for a fucking 40 yr old to try and iso at the top of the key, especially when he just twisted his ankle.

Whenever we go on a run and go up big he subs the players out who was a catalyst for that run instantly.

It's a weird tendency that he has this team isn't Milwaukee to where Giannis Middleton and Jrue could take a break and the lead blossoms 6 more points.

He threw Lebron on the bench late in the 3rd vs the Clippers the 2nd game of the season that happened.

AD sat for 8 straight minutes vs the Cavs and the Kings the final 4 minutes of the 3rd and 1st 4 minutes of the 4th.

Pulled Russ last night when he had it going and the lead immediately went from 17 to single digits in minutes.

the 9 guys who should be playing are AD, Lebron, Bryant, Gabriel as the frontcourt...Brown, Walker, Reaves, Westbrook, Schroeder in the backcourt...Beverly, Nunn, Christie, JTA, Jones, Ryan... all should be getting minimal playing time...

3207,2022-11-30 02:04:17,z8dti3,Really not understanding the Lebron hate,_BTFan,"Let me start with this: Lebron did not play well last night. But why are we ignoring context? He dropped 10 points in 3 minutes and then rolled his ankle. He was clearly injured ever since. 

Now to those saying he should‚Äôve just sat out - that‚Äôs easy to say after a loss. But have you ever seen an NBA player, let alone one who‚Äôs been competing for over half his life, take himself out of a game unless it was a bad injury? What would you/the media say if he did take himself out? ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs old/washed/soft/unreliable.‚Äù And either way it would be on Darvin Ham to take him out of the game. 

While he didn‚Äôt have a good game, I really don‚Äôt think this team would‚Äôve been in any semblance of a better position with him off the court. Who would‚Äôve taken his minutes, Kendrick Nunn? I‚Äôd still take Lebron even just for his passing and the attention he gets from the defense. 

And lastly did you guys already forget this guy averaged 30 last year and dropped 39 literally 3 days ago? Come on lol",1.0

Here's the list of decisions that were terrible:

1) Breaking up the 19-20 championship roster (I agreed with this decision at the time because I didn't think that roster was equipped for another deep playoffs run)

2) Trading for WB (I knew this was a bad decision the moment at the time)

3) Letting AC go and opting to keep THT (I knew this was a bad decision at the time)

\#2 is probably the biggest one, and the one we've been complaining about the most, but should Pelinka hold the weight of this? I recall hearing that Lebron &amp; AD were onboard with WB.

3239,2022-11-30 19:35:05,z90ttv,Jovan Buha places some blame on Darvin Ham. Do you agree?,Bussin_Out,"TLDR: advanced stats suggest the lakers are at their worst with Westbrook in the closing lineup. Should he still be in the lineup? How to make it work if he is? If not, what‚Äôs the alternative?


Jovan Buha appeared on Lakers Talk with Allen Sliwa and he puts some of the blame on Ham for not establishing a pecking order in terms of who gets shots. He wonders if Ham is just trying to appease Westbrook by having him in crunch time moments.  He says there was too much Westbrook in that 4th quarter Pacers collapse by pointing out it was lot of Westbrook and AD PNRs that ended up with Westbrook taking shots he shouldn‚Äôt be taking. He also said Westbrook shouldn‚Äôt be in crunch time lineups due to  bad decision making. He stated Westbrook has tendency to look for his own shot and take the bait from defenses by taking shots he shouldn‚Äôt. He says it has hurt the team this season and last. 

The Locked on Lakers podcast hosts echoed these sentiments in that Westbrook shouldn‚Äôt be closing games due to poor decision making with added poor defense. They shared it‚Äôs highlighted in the Pacers loss but I still believe everyone contributed to the collapse ( [here‚Äôs a thread on that](https://twitter.com/rajchipalu/status/1597491971681316864?s=46&amp;t=rfGfq00QMnjskrrCt0Jqjw)) They also looked at advanced stats of the big 3 in 4th quarters on the season. 

AD is -4.9
Lebron is -9.4
Westbrook is -26.3

This begs the question. Should Westbrook play in the 4th quarter? If so, how do they make it work? If not, who should be in the closing lineup instead?",1.0

I'm a huge UCLA basketball fan. When WB came out of UCLA and entered the draft, I labeled him fools gold, all the way back then. I know that too many people get enamored w/ athleticism, over bBallIQ. It's taken maybe 20+ years before the NBA has finally been catching up the fact that you need high bBallIQ players and great outside shooters to win championships. You can't win championships w/ key players that have epically low BballIQ's... it just doesn't happen... ever.

&amp;#x200B;

When given enough of a sample size, +/- combined w/ PER are great general overall stat indicators of a players value when on the court. 

Westbrook this year = -36

Reaves this year = +25

================================

Westbrook last year = -211

Reaves last year = +54

&amp;#x200B;

This isn't another dump on Russ post. I hope it's more educational in the sense of you don't need to have insane dunks, speed, or athleticism. What you need to be a valuable basketball player is UNDERSTAND the fking game and learn how to play smart! 

If you currently play HS basketball or at whatever level, my advice as a former bball coach is - understand and study the games of high BballIQ players. The little things that are done either correctly, or incorrectly add up on the court over time. It's setting the correct screen, running to the correct open space, making the correct angle pass, etc.. Understand the game... study it like Kobe did, and you'll go far, no matter what your current level of athleticism is.",1.0

If you've been watching all year, he wasn't playing like this;  he was holding the ball in the midpost or on the wing. Real Lakers fans just want the team to play better and part of that is being realistic about when the stars aren't playing the right way. Westbrook had to come off the bench, AD had to stop posting up and shooting jumpers; and now Bron had to be more decisive. Hopefully they stay consistent and we get to the playoffs",1.0

Comparing the first half of our season so far, to the 2nd half: **none** of the bottom 5 teams in Net Rating have changed, **except for LAL**  who shot up from 29th to 5th. 

It's tempting to say that we're somewhere in the middle, especially given the strength of schedule. If that's the case, we are sitting at around -1.1 pts per 100 possessions which is actually a pretty big upgrade from last year, and probably means we're a playoff team.

That said, a lot of the numbers from those first 10 games actually seem less sustainable than the last 10 games - particularly: 3P% (30th), Fouls Drawn (24th), Offensive Rebounds (23rd). 

On the flip side, not much from our last 10 games seem all that unsustainable other than an easier schedule. What do you all think?",1.0

Here‚Äôs a legitimate plan to keep Reaves and Walker. Trade Bev, and a FRP for Kuz at 13M. (Or another player at about 13 M). That means we can use up to 12 M to resign Walker, then the MLE at 6M for Reaves. Any player traded higher salary means we can‚Äôt resign these prices. Now if I‚Äôm wrong on the cap , basically trade to have enough for Walker at around 12M , using the MLE for Reaves.
Then we only have vet mins, then comes bird rights‚Ä¶

Unfortunately, use bird rights to resign Westbrook and Nunn. Maybe Russ at 10M, we can resign Nunn to 120% of his current salary , so about 7.2 M. Benchbrook is great 6th man material. And Nunn didn‚Äôt just forget basketball, although he sucks this year so far, he‚Äôll probably be better than a vet min and should be able to turn around eventually. We‚Äôre already capped just resigning Reaves and Walker after a trade. Might as well.

He backpeddled into the post TWICE to double team Holiday leaving Lopez wide open on the three which resulted in Lopez hitting both shots totalling 6 easy points. Why does he keep doing this? Especially when a defender is already on Holiday? Why is he leaving one of the better shooting big men wide open then complaining when he knocks down shots? 

In one play, he didn‚Äôt switch on Middleton, which cause Beverly to overplay, leaving Holiday wide open in the corner. Khris got the easy pass and Holiday got another 3. Then he had one possession where he backed off Portis entirely resulting in another easy 3. Let‚Äôs not forget Holidays open three because Lebron didn‚Äôt run back on defense. Lebron is killing the Lakers with his lazy defensive effort, he‚Äôs easily allowed 4-5 easy threes this game alone either because he didn‚Äôt bother playing defense or didn‚Äôt commit to the switch. 

I hope somebody in the locker room calls him out when they review this game because it‚Äôs been so obvious and yet I don‚Äôt see any Lakers fans talking about it. He‚Äôs routinely messing up defensively then blaming other people, I‚Äôd be pissed if I was his teammate. This is purely a critical analysis, I‚Äôm not a Lebron hater, saying he should be traded or anything like that.

Which would you prefer?",Apart-Bad-5446,"One or two of them have to be traded if the Lakers want to make a decent trade of value. With Russ playing very well off the bench, the notion that the Lakers have to give up picks to desperately get rid of Russ isn't as true as it was before the season started when almost everyone agreed that you had to give up at least two first if you wanted to trade Russ. Any team taking on Russ's contract is moot at this point because they'd be giving up equal salary and if it's a player they don't want long-term, Russ is a good salary dump for them. 

On the other hand, Pat Bev hasn't played well offensively but he's the only other player with any decent trade value in terms of making the salary work. I think if you're going to trade Bev, you'd have to look at adding Jones and Nunn as well. IMO, the Lakers are probably going to keep playing Bev heavy minutes so they can boost his trade value rather than benching him and giving the impression that the Lakers don't want him.

Which do you prefer? Giving up Russ+two first rounders or Pat Bev+Nunn and one first rounder? Or a combination of Pat Bev, Russ, and Nunn with two first rounders if they are able to land a huge haul?

Either way, a trade is likely imminent. The front office has to have seen what every other Lakers fan saw: This team has the potential to win the chip with just another couple of players.",1.0

3363,2022-12-03 04:08:23,zb77cs,Would a trade for Bogdanoviƒá and Bey from the Pistons be possible for LA?,CCPalmeri5,"Saw someone post possible trades the Lakers could make and this was one of them. At first I thought ‚Äúno way‚Äù, but after further evaluation I could see a world where the Lakers could get this done.

Bev, Nunn, and a 1st for Bogdanoviƒá and Bey

The salaries work out because Bey only costs a little under $3 million this season. It‚Äôs been reported that Detroit is willing to listen to offers on him, which was surprising at first, but he‚Äôs actually kinda struggling this year and has recently been benched. Bogdanoviƒá could be tricky because he‚Äôs likely going to draw a lot of interest around the league from contenders. Do they offer more than a 1st in the near future, idk, but I think the Lakers pick in ‚Äò27 or ‚Äò29 could be more valuable than a contender‚Äôs 1st in this upcoming draft or next.

So I guess I‚Äôm asking if this trade is realistic? I think it‚Äôd be awesome for the Lakers because you get 2 true wings who can shoot. Not sure what they offer on defense, but they‚Äôd both immediately be some of the Laker‚Äôs tallest players and Bogdanoviƒá would be a starter. What do y‚Äôall think?",1.0

3379,2022-12-03 05:18:04,zb8h0j,Can we have an honest and updated discussion about Pelinka?,BrianC_,"For weeks, this guy was getting absolutely blasted here with people linking every sort of article nitpicking his mistakes.  I don't know how many times I've had to hear people say he sucks at asset management, loses every single deal on the fringes, and only has a job because of Kobe.

Has he been perfect?  No.  Absolutely not.  I've absolutely hated him for some of the mistakes he has made.  But, most of his mistakes have been small aside from Westbrook.

On the other hand, people constantly criticized him for having no idea how to build a team.  He built the 2019-2020 championship squad.  He built another contender in 2020-2021 -- and no, he did not break up the 2019-2020 team, players like Rondo decided to leave for more money.  He whiffed hard last year.  So many people wrote this roster off before it ever got the chance to mature.  But, after getting a chance to really prove themselves, this team is looking more and more like it's pretty well built.

At the end of the day, the goal of the GM is to build a good roster.  It's looking like he might be 3/4.  Some bitter haters will say Pelinka got lucky.  You can only get lucky so many times before it's not luck anymore.

As I see this roster, they're really 1 solid wing away from being objectively a strong roster.

I'll admit that I wasn't a fan of some of the signings.  I was scratching my hair out wondering why the team used their TPMLE on Lonnie Walker IV.  Some of the other signings I liked turned out to be duds -- JTA and Jones.  But, looking at how this team is built, it makes sense.  Everyone here has been calling Pelinka stupid for weeks.  How stupid does he look now?

Around the core and leadership of LeBron, AD, and Westbrook, you have a TON of athleticism, versatility, energy, and youth.  The role-players are high-motor guys that play the game HARD and with focused effort.

Between AD, LeBron, and Westbrook, you have 48 minutes a night of someone that can competently be the focal point of your offense.  Since moving to the bench, Westbrook's playmaking has been invaluable to guys like Wenyen Gabriel.

You have multiple guys that can create their own shot or create for others in spurts while also being respectable defenders.  Lonnie Walker IV.  Austin Reaves.

You have multiple guys that don't need the ball to succeed and will find their points in the gaps while playing respectable defense.  Pat Bev.  Wenyen Gabriel.  TBJ.

You have a ton of offensive finishing power in the paint and enough shooting after the team recovered from a historic shooting slump early in the season.

You have guys that will sell their ass on a street corner for a defensive stop.  That's the level of buy-in these guys are showing.

And, most importantly, everyone can accept their roles on this team because their role is so clearly defined by what they're good at.  That's a clear sign of a well built roster and a well coached team.

Watching these guys play has been a joy even if the record isn't great yet.  Just imagine for a second that Jones and JTA turned out to also be solid contributors.  This team would be rock solid with another back-up big and defensive wing.

I think unfortunately, this team is still not very deep.  But, that's just the reality of what happens when you have 3 max players.  We just have to hope that this team can stay healthy.

All this team really needs at this point is a bit more size -- ideally a bigger 3&amp;D swing.  And, they've got movable draft picks and enough mid-size salary value to get a deal done.  The fact that this team is so close to being a great roster says all it needs to about how it was built.",1.0

With a 2-10 start, the Lakers have gone 7-2 since, with the only losses being to the Suns (best team in the west) and the Pacers. 

The Pacers game sucks as we were one shot from a 2k generated player away from being 8-1, but the loss to the Suns is totally acceptable. 

With that being said, the Lakers are playing great, shooting well from the field and even the 3 (37%) in that stretch. We are 6th in Net rating, 9th in offense and 5th in defense! AD is dominating and Lebron seems to be back and playing great as well. 

Our role players are playing good too as Lonnie is having a career year, hitting crazy dunks, splashing threes and actually playing good defense. Reaves is shooting fucking 50/40/90, Schroder and TB have been good since coming back, Westbrook has been better off the bench. 

With all that being said, I think the time is now for the Lakers to pull off a trade and ship Westbrook out of here. With a good trade, I actually believe the Lakers could contend with some of the best teams in the league and even make push for a top 5 seed",0.77

You better try to score early, so that you have another possession to try to score again. 2 for 1 makes sense here.

But if, on the other hand, let's say you are ***ahead*** by 2 points, then using 10 seconds to get up a shitty shot, followed by the other team using their 24 seconds, so that you get another 10 seconds to get up another shitty shot. That doesn't make sense unless your name is Steph or Dame and the shot is routine. Otherwise, why would I trade one good possession for two shitty possessions if I am not forced to do so?",1.0

Russ, 1 Laker first(unprotected) for Rozier, PJ, Oubre. Get two expiring 6‚Äô7, 6‚Äô8 wings that have a capable shot as well as a young ball handler in Rozier to replace Russ.

Pat Bev, Kendrick Nunn, 1 laker first(protected) for Myles Turner. A former DPOY candidate playing well this season that‚Äôll take pressure off AD and form the best paint defense in the league.

With these moves the team has acquired a younger ball handler that can shoot better, two 6‚Äô7 wings, and a floor spacing big.",1.0

He's dominating the paint which has resulted in easy shots, high efficiency, and dominating the boards. This is by far his best rebounding season with a career high in offensive rebounding.

Coach Ham realized that 38 years old Lebron postup for late game stretch isn't working, and he also created a rotation that Lebron Russ and AD getting good amount of rest and playing time. Crucial especially when we think lebron was able to defend and score in crucial moment and AD with less foul troubles.

It was also remarkable how turnovers has decreased immensely, especially from Russ and Lebron. Russ played like a 'pointguard'. Just high quality pnr passes, kickouts and assists to AD. We only had 4(!!) turnovers for entire game against the league's number 1 defensive team. 

This is just a excellent start for 6 game road trip, especially when we beat the team who played excellent for their standard also and their full squad.",1.0

Not to mention Russ looks really good off the bench as well, the whole team just looks really fluid with the exception of a few players.

At the moment, I do not think we should trade Russ. He‚Äôs playing well, and that would really ruin the chemistry we‚Äôve built thus far. Unless the front office thinks we have a LEGITIMATE chance to contend if we trade Russ I don‚Äôt think they should. This is his last year on the books then we will have the flexibility to sign solid players in free agency in the summer, and keep one or BOTH of our first‚Äôs. 

I would much rather prefer a trade package of Nunn, Bev, maybe one first, and a couple seconds for a solid backup big man to play behind AD. I know we need wings but I like a couple free agents, those being Josh Jackson who is 6‚Äô8 and Mo Hark who‚Äôs 6‚Äô9.

I don't know if the weights are up to date or how the players were weighed since weight can fluctuate quite a bit throughout the day or day to day depending on what's in the GI food tract and water retention. 

Assuming they're accurate, I have a hard time seeing how Giannis doesn't weigh 10-20lbs more than AD. Giannis is the same height or slightly taller and visibly looks a lot more muscular.

I know these trades are easier said than done since the Spurs hate us and the Wizards might just want to keep Kuzma for all we know. But I think the front office needs to go hard after these two players with all their pick assets.

I think our biggest hole on the roster is at the 4, and he seems like the perfect 4 to slot in next to Schroeder, Lonnie, bron, and AD in the starting lineup. 

On the Wizards side, this trade is assuming they want to be sellers at the deadline and lean into the tank. They are at very best a 9 or 10 seed in the competitive eastern conference, and if they DO make the playoffs, then they lose their draft pick this year. They  only keep their pick if they‚Äôre in the lottery. Given the direction of the franchise I think most would agree to embrace the tank and try for an chance at Wemby.

3515,2022-12-05 10:59:43,zd3tn0,How to turn the Lakers into contenders: play through AD with RWB running the offense and LBJ being our defense anchor.,ProRainmaker,"Hear me out.  

I think we should be running AD as our primary option (ala 2000 Shaq) with RWB being our playmaker (ala 80s Magic) and LeBron our hound guard (ala 2000 Kobe or 2010 Artest/MWP).  

First thing-AD.

I think I will skimp over, but I think the last 10 games clearly showed us what playing through AD can mean for us.  

Now onto RWB.  

I absolutely hated it when everyone was calling RWB busted, useless and worthless.  No, he isn't.  Obviously he isn't at his MVP level, but he remains a very good player.  

I find it ridiculous that everyone forgets that the season before he came to the Lakers, he was averaging 22/12/12 and dragged a bad Wizards team back into the playoffs; granted they were eliminated in the first round easily.  It's funny that a player that did something like this lands on a team and suddenly becomes a cancer. 

The problem with LBJ's teams is that everyone else kind of relegates to a more passive role.  It happened with Bosh and it happened with Love.  Wade and Irving also had to take half a step back. 

Look, before all the LBJ fans come snapping at me, yes, LBJ was and still is a great player.  But he doesn't exactly magnify his teammates' strengths, he doesn't make them better.  In terms of team's output, he is more of a MJ/Kobe/Iverson type-he needs others to cover his flaws.  He is not Magic, Stockton or Isiash Thomas (Detroit).  Yes, he's creeping up the assists list but that's because he is able to pull defenders to him and then make the good pass out.  That doesn't mean he is able to amplify his teammate's strengths.  But again, that doesn't mean him a lesser player, just a different player.  

Now that we finally realize that AD can be a beast if we play through him, we need to realize that RWB can make us contenders-yes, contenders.  

Off-the-bench RWB is good, because he was given free reign.  And that's what he needs to be doing, not jacking 3s in an offense oriented around LBJ.  Look at what he did for us today-15 assists with 10 going to AD.  Anyone who says RWB is selfish is clearly simply reading tabloid news.  RWB is the best person to run alongside AD-a PG who is fearless and an able passer.  

And now here comes the crux-why not AD/LBJ but AD/RWB?  What's the advantage?  

No, there isn't really an advantage.  RWB feeding into AD or LBJ feeding into AD are around the same levels; you can argue otherwise for either, although most will claim the latter will be a better combo which I will claim is due to recency bias, but screw it, let's go with that claim.

The difference is, LBJ is miles better on defence.  By giving RWB the keys to the offense, we solve the problem of him playing or not playing.  On the other hand, we can keep LeBron fresh on defense and he will be our defense anchor.

Now, let's do a 22 years flashback.  The 2000 Lakers won on the back of Shaq simply destroying everything in the way.  However, they were also anchored by a very strong defensive stopper in Kobe.  We can literally clone this recipe with AD playing the role of Shaq and LBJ that of Kobe.  Keeping LBJ fresh as third option is also great because on days that AD is off (eg 2000 WCF Game 7, 2000 NBA Finals Game 4), LBJ can burst onto the scene and do what Kobe did for us.  

We have a recipe for success.  An exact clone duplicate.  

We asked at the start of the season-do we dare to bench RWB?

Now the question can be-do we dare to ask LBJ to step down?",0.5

As a fellow Bruin who went to multiple summer classes with Russ, I will always root for him to succeed. But for the Lakers to achieve meaningful playoff success, we need much more than 15/7/7 for $47M in salary, especially in the playoffs when Russ has historically performed worse.

Coming into the season the goal was to stay afloat before a Russ trade and if possible restore some of Russ‚Äô trade value. Miraculously that‚Äôs what we have accomplished thus far. We are one Pacer‚Äôs win away from .500 amidst a brutal schedule and historically bad luck, and Russ has demonstrated he‚Äôs still a player that can at least contribute to regular season winning. There are multiple teams around the league that desperately needs better primary guard play(Mavs/Heat/Clippers etc). It‚Äôs time to cash in on Russ while his value is still high.",1.0

KD and Dirk (Lebron can body them but they‚Äôre too tall and too good of shooters. They can just shoot over him)

MJ and Kobe (have too many moves to bet on stopping 1 on 1. We never seen MJ/Lebron March up, but we seen Kobe cook Lebron time after time 1 on 1. And MJ and Kobe are basically the same offensively)

TD and Blake are not as skilled offensively as the other 4, but they‚Äôre strong enough to body Lebron for a hook.

Idk what to make of Giannis. He‚Äôs not really that offensively skilled like the others, but he‚Äôs fast, long, and strong enough to give Lebron problems. He might get him off the dribble.",1.0

Write a story about Barack Obama but replace his last term in office with being the point guard of LA Lakers

Output:
Barack Obama was never one to shy away from a challenge. So when the opportunity presented itself for him to become the point guard of the LA Lakers, he jumped at the chance.

As the former President of the United States, Obama was no stranger to the spotlight. But stepping onto the court as a professional basketball player was a whole new level of pressure.

At first, Obama struggled to adjust to the faster pace of the game. He was used to making calculated decisions and executing them with precision, but basketball required a different kind of quick thinking and agility.

But Obama was determined to succeed. He spent hours practicing his ball-handling skills and studying game tapes to learn the strategies of his opponents. His hard work paid off, and soon he was dishing out assists and making clutch shots with the best of them.

The Lakers quickly became a force to be reckoned with, thanks in part to Obama's leadership on the court. He inspired his teammates with his tireless work ethic and unshakeable confidence.

In his first season with the Lakers, Obama led the team to the playoffs, where they faced off against the Golden State Warriors in a nail-biting seven-game series. Obama put on an incredible performance, scoring a career-high 40 points in the deciding game to secure the win for the Lakers.

The victory was a historic moment for both 
Obama and the Lakers franchise. It was the first time in over a decade that the team had won a championship, and Obama was hailed as a hero for his role in bringing the title back to LA.

Obama continued to play for the Lakers for the next few seasons, cementing his legacy as one of the greatest point guards in the history of the game. And though he may have left the world of politics behind, his impact on the court was just as great as it was in the White House.",1.0

if you are under that assumption than trading both picks in a final ""get us over the top trade"" is the obvious next move...Lakers currently have no players of value to any team other than expiring contracts to match salary...so the two picks are what will separate them in the trade market from other teams who do actually have decent players who can contribute in a trade...

Myles Turner for Bev/Nunn two 1sts... Vanderbilt, Beasley for two 1sts...
OG Anunoby for two 1sts... etc...

3571,2022-12-06 21:31:25,zeipzl,Thoughts on the potential Kuzma reunion rumors?,TorontoRaptors34,"Me personally, I am on the split ends with it. He has grown a little bit and gotten better as a player with a bigger role. Sure he has flaws like everyone taking bad shots and turning the ball over. But he would be a solid forward wing that could give this team size and I think with more support from fans not expecting him to be a star will help him succeed. You could tell he hasn‚Äôt gotten over the trade and wants to be a Laker given how much he trolls the organization and LeBron. Hell, even Lonzo wants to come back but thats another conversation. 

I think one thing people forgot is how much hate he received its a love letter compared to the hate Russ has gotten this past yr but he got his fair share of hate. Mofos were trashing him saying he deserves to play in China and that the only reason he on the team is cuz he piping Jeanie. But after last yr I think everyone was so focused on what he wasn‚Äôt that they forgot what he could offer and thats the energy and effort on both ends as well as size. If he returns he prob won‚Äôt score as much but he can provide and extra defender in the paint and the perimeter as well as chemistry with the stars. Not to mention him and Ham will get along cuz of there Michigan connections. 

I would however like to mention that Kuz welcomed a change because he wanted to grow as a player and get a bigger role which is kinda what he has in DC. But who knows maybe he realized that it didn‚Äôt bring him the joy he thought and he misses the bright lights. I think maybe now that theres less expected of him he‚Äôd do better especially next to the best of the best elite playmakers of Russ and Bron. It would be funny to have Russ and Kuz on the same team but who cares. Having Kuz would also take scoring load off of guys like Bron and Russ as well as help AD. Not to mention Kuz and TB reunion too. PJ washington would be a better fit given hes a better shooter I will say that but Kuz is better at everything else and is a respectable shooter too so theres that.

Do I think it will happen ehh no but crazier things have occurred and its clear as day Kuz wants to come back. Lets not kid ourselves. But rumors r jus rumors until a series outlet has said something.",1.0

What you need is as close to an Andrew Wiggins comp as you can get. A versatile wing with length who can carry a high workload on defense, and contribute on defense. Preferably with some decent 3 range.

You need that even more than pure shooters. Otherwise too much of the defense load is on Lebron or tall wings like Kuzma get to have a field day shooting over smaller lakers guards.  

Who‚Äôs that guy? Who could they realistically get? Here‚Äôs what I came up with, but I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs a better answer.‚Ä¶  

Jarred Vanderbilt - Back to the Utah well? He‚Äôs playing really well, shooting 46% from 3 on the year, and only 23yo with a $4.3 mil/year cap hit. 

Kuzma - Ironic that he‚Äôs the perfect fit. No time to be proud though. If Wizards nose dive, make the call and try to bring him back. 27 years old with a 13 mil cap hit.  

Patrick Williams - Bulls may decide to blow it up, and they just demoted Williams to the bench. Only 21, which isn‚Äôt ideal if you need him to contribute immediately, but he‚Äôs 6‚Äô7, shooting 42% from 3 this year, and only a $7.75 mil cap hit (3 mil less then Nunn).  

Dorian Finney-Smith - Epitome of a 3&amp;d player. 29 years old, only a 12 mil cap hit. He‚Äôs also having a really off year so far. If the Mavs continue to struggle could Lakers land him relatively cheap in a 3 way?

Please don‚Äôt trade for 6-6‚Äô3 shooters. Please don‚Äôt trade for someone who will fuck up the spacing for AD‚Ä¶just have to assume he‚Äôll be healthy or it doesn‚Äôt matter who they get. Please don‚Äôt trade for some 6‚Äô7 33 year old forward who can‚Äôt be a workhorse on defense and will be washed in 3 years (Bogdanovic‚Ä¶I‚Äôm looking at you).",1.0

3602,2022-12-07 17:26:04,zf7brf,Legitimacy of 2020 Championship Can Not Be Challenged,MrBones2k,"I was just watching ""Legacy: The True Story of the LA Lakers"" on Hulu, and the final episode covers the 2020 Championship that took place in ""The Bubble"" in Orlando.

It really struck me how DIFFICULT this Championship was to bring home, and further solidified in my mind the ""legitimacy"" of this title, and I wanted to put down some thoughts.

Main reasons:

1. Kobe died tragically during the season (RIP Mamba).  He was a player and person that likely every single member of the team (and organization) respected and/or idolized.  This was a devastating loss to the Lakers players, org, fans, and more, and not something that one could simply put aside from an emotional perspective. Yet the Lakers kept their focus.
2. All players, on all teams, were dealing with what was a once-in-a-lifetime pandemic (hopefully).  They, their family, friends, and everyone they knew and didn't know*,* worldwide, were all at risk of an unknown virus, that was killing thousands of people a day worldwide.  And they were away from their families during this time. Yet the Lakers kept their focus.
3. George Floyd was murdered.  Followed by the police shooting of Jacob Blake.  Followed by mass protests across the USA, and in many places overseas.  The majority of the Lakers at the time were Black men, so these events undoubtedly hit them (and their loved ones and communities) very hard.  Yet the Lakers kept their focus.
4. The players were separated from their family and friends, and their homes, for over 90 days.  Yet the Lakers kept their focus.

AND, lest anyone tries to cheapen this Championship: all teams had an opportunity to play and win in under similar circumstances.  Yet only the Lakers kept their focus enough to win the Championship.

Anyone that tries to argue that this Championship is somehow ""lesser"" is obviously speaking from a place of jealousy or envy, because their team failed, where the Lakers (again) succeeded.",1.0

3624,2022-12-08 04:39:47,zfp5iy,"Trading 1 pick is a half measure - either push the chips in or ride it out, but do not straddle the fence and try to do both at once",suhar97,"The truth of the matter with this team is that if they want to do anything then they will have to move both picks this year. There‚Äôs plenty of posts around why they should go all in (i.e., an open western conference, AD playing mvp quality ball, lebron still capable of producing when healthy).

If you make one smaller deal, the ceiling of the team marginally improves. Yes, they will probably comfortably get into play in range or, in an upside case, crack the top 6. 

The issue is from there - then what? So long as Russ‚Äô contract is on the books, this team‚Äôs ceiling will forever be capped. He‚Äôs been great this year, but his production is not that of 47m and, in a salary capped league, that creates  a structural deficiency. Again, nothing against russ the player or guy but everything against russ the contract.

Shipping out Nunn, Beverly, and Russ in 2 separate deals each with 1 FRP is enough 1) moveable salary and 2) assets (note, the lakers picks are highly coveted) where you can totally restructure this roster with better fitting pieces alongside lebron and AD. If you have concerns about playmaking, imo Dennis, Lonnie, Austin, Lebron is enough, not to mention AD being able to create in space. If you don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs enough then fine bring back a playmaker in either of the deals.

Alternatively, if you do not want to do the above, then just punt and say you‚Äôre punting and quit the charade. The worst thing you can do is then move 1 pick for a marginal upgrade - at that point just hold onto all the assets and cash it in alongside the 2023 pick this summer. This path comes with the risk of angering lebron and ad and that piece does not get as much attention as it should imo. 

Regardless, no ‚Äúfringe‚Äù moves, please.",1.0

He's shooting 40.6 % FG 30% 3PT and 69.1% FT on 3.6 TOV.

I know stats aren't everything and I can see what he's bringing off the bench but we clearly are lacking in the wing and big department. We cant risk our bigs getting injured like the cavs game and running a 4 guard lineup is basically just accepting a loss that game.

1. This team has some fight in them - the way they were able to come back and force OT was amazing. Never gave up even when down double digits in the fourth

2. AD is a freakin monster - clearly our best player

3. AD, LBJ, Russ combo is pretty damn good when it‚Äôs working - their chemistry is starting to show which is nice, hopefully it only continues to get better

4. We need some shooters badly - Reeves had a great game today but definitely can‚Äôt rely on him to be that guy. Someone else needs to step up, or we‚Äôre really just one player away from being legit

The problem is that his production is way below his contract value right now. He can no longer get to the rim at will off the dribble, despite way fewer attempts. His step is just too slow to get past anyone, which is also why he can't stay in front of anyone on D. 

Also, his slow step/ lower vertical leads to tougher shots/defense, which means he can't finish at his rate anymore. He seems like he's imitating westbrick layups out there most of the time, for the majority of this season. Sad to see.

So pretty much, his game right now is entirely dependent on whether his 3ball/ jumpshot is falling. Unfortunately, he's a mediocre shooter. He's getting paid max money to be a mediocre shooter/ shit defender, with fancy plays every once in a while like any decent role player.

But you know who you can blame , RUSS AND BRON. Bron was 9-22 (1-8 3pt) all he did was shot hack there‚Äôs slowing the offense down and OT he didn‚Äôt score once.

Russ needs to be traded he‚Äôs so inefficient even coming off the bench averaging 15 on 40% 29%3pt and 68ft he ain‚Äôt worth 47 mil . 

Also blame it on the horrible permiter defesne we have no good wings, and hamm loves putting 4 guards out there and embiid destroyed it. We let a random go off for 30 points. This team just is net good enough win, we probably won‚Äôt make the playoffs or play in if something doesn‚Äôt happen.

Lebron is refusing to cede the keys, even when it‚Äôs clear he‚Äôs not even close to being the best player on this team.

Lebron‚Äôs averaging 21.6 shots a game this season, 7.3 of which are from three when he‚Äôs only shooting .318 from downtown, which is his fourth lowest shooting percentage from 3 in his entire career. This season is the second highest amount of shots he‚Äôs averaged in 15 seasons. (He averaged 21.8 shots last year.) He‚Äôs only ever averaged more shots in 2007-2008 (21.9) and 2005-2006 (23.1). (For perspective, Kobe Bryant, who is  (wrongly) stigmatized as a ball hog chucker, only averaged more shots than Lebron is this season 5 times in his 20 year career.)

By comparison, AD is only averaging 17.3 shots per game. He averaged more shots last season (17.4) and his first year with the lakers (17.7). Coincidentally, the year in which AD averaged the most shots since he‚Äôs been on the Lakers was the year we won the title. When he was with the pelicans, he averaged more than 17.3 shots per game in all but his first two seasons. AD is the number one on this team. Lebron is the 2.

Under no circumstances should Lebron be averaging 4.3 more shots per game than AD, especially when AD is shooting 59% and Lebron is shooting 46%. Those 4.3 shots being given to AD instead of Lebron can easily translate to 8-10 more points per game, especially since AD shoots better at 2s, 3s, and free throws than Lebron.

Lebron is doing a lot of shit this season (except playing defense). Deferring to AD is not one of them. AD does not initiate the offense and is not a ball handler. He has to rely on Lebron, Russ, and the others to get him the ball. The Lakers around AD need to get him the ball the way the NOP got AD the ball. Even when AD played alongside boogie, he got more shots than he gets now. Instead, Lebron is ball hogging the shit and costing us games. See last game. He and Russ completely froze AD out for hero ball when AD was the one who brought us back in the game.",1.0

Personally, I know many have talked about Bev Nunn JTA Dame as guys to give up but ion see why Dennis is left out the picture. When you look at his play he by no means is bad but doesn't do a whole lot to help the team either. Sure he doesn't turn the ball over a whole lot and plays kinda moderate speed wise but those are kinda the bare minimum. He is a solid defender but he isn't great either and doesn't do anything to move the needle. You got LeBron James and Russell Westbrook who are the best in the business at doing that and have HOF careers because of it. Why would u need handlers. Not to mention Dennis doens't really feed AD the ball either. He also I feel kinda gets in the way of Lonnie at times. 

With that being said he is a solid pg that can help a flurry of teams around the league that could get u back something like an Alec Burks or even in Houston with Garrison Mathews who isn't really valued a whole lot. 

While many have talked about Bev's struggles I feel he is too important to the team to get rid of as far as being a glue guy. While he isn't a lot on offense he has been imporving slightly and if u get rid of Dennis Nunn Dame and JTA for some wings I mentioned above like Cam, Burks, Livers, and maybe Garrison Mathews. Bev can be unleashed as a pure irritant in spot minutes.",1.0

3878,2022-12-14 06:17:30,zljhok,There‚Äôs a fundamental problem here that we need to address,kronos9797,"This game sucked. I was ready to give up hope and was absolutely amazed at how we got ahead by 13 in the 4th there. AD missed free throws, LeBron hoisted 3s but I think the crucial point here is AD had to play the entire second half and Lebron was out for like all but 4 mins.

That‚Äôs not normal, those are playoff minutes and there‚Äôs a reason why playoff basketball is a different beast. Asking a 38 year old LeBron to score every single trip down the end and asking AD to give his all on offense and defense is just unrealistic and not sustainable. We need role players to step up, heck even Boston required shots from both Williams and Smart (role players) to survive tonight.

There‚Äôs 3 plays I feel that had it gone our way might have definitely helped. There‚Äôs the 2 point gift off the inbound to Marcus Smart. The opportune 3 point play in the fast break where Lebron was right at the rim and had it been counted extended our lead in the dying moments. Instead he missed the and-1 bucket and made only 1-2 FTs (so potential 1 point out of 3). And obviously the 2 missed FTs by AD and believe you me, I‚Äôm sure he doesn‚Äôt care one bit about his total points etc and is just as mad at himself as us.

Now I‚Äôm not trying to come here to defend LeBron and AD. If anything what I‚Äôm trying to say is come playoff time, I have 100% belief that they will be killing it night in night out. Today showed us that they go toe to toe for the best 1-2 punches with any duo in the league. The problem is the rest of our roster is just so so bad that them being great doesn‚Äôt make up the difference. 

Sure we might win a few close games by asking them to play like their playoff selves but that‚Äôs just not sustainable. We need roster reinforcements, we need them soon if we have to salvage anything this season. 

Side note: I don‚Äôt know if the Stepien rule applies for second round picks but if it doesn‚Äôt I would trade every single second round pick for the rest of the decade to get both Bogdanovic and another defensive wing to us. We‚Äôve already seen these picks can be bought so I really don‚Äôt see the reasoning behind not offering more second round picks if they help move the needle.",0.71

They just need someone to give them 10-15 minutes a night, a real NBA player. Why would Pistons trade with Lakers right now, how is it in their best interest at all?? 

It‚Äôs just so obvious that everyone wants to prey on us, but how can you blame them.. we are in such a shitty spot. However, if we don‚Äôt stack wins in the month of December, the FO will have every reason to throw the season away at that point. A trade moving a first in Jan/Feb, with a bad record WOULDNT make sense. 

Just have to make a small move right now and give us any resemblance of depth. Maybe a second PF behind LeBron, he needs rest too. ANYTHING will be better than Nunn

A lot of people are acting like he‚Äôs this indispensable key to winning all of the sudden.

This, as the title implies, is an absurd notion.

Yes, he‚Äôs been better.

Yes, he deserves credit for being a pro this season. 

Yes, he has had spurts of absolute brilliance.

However, as we, once again, saw tonight, he‚Äôs way too erratic. One quarter, he‚Äôs brilliant. The other, he‚Äôs a disaster again. Hell, just look at this OT for Christ‚Äôs sake. Started off incredible, only to once again become a liability when it matters most. In case y‚Äôall forgot, him being left open in the clutch is exactly how he‚Äôs been exposed time and time again in the playoffs (including by us back in 2020, might I add!).

Now, if the dude was making $10-15 mil (like the average 6th man), I could live with it. However, at $47 mil, that fact is just crushing for us. We can‚Äôt being paying that much money to one guy who can‚Äôt depended on in the most important moments. 

This is something that also makes meaningfully upgrading this team damn-near impossible. I agree that trading Beverly and Nunn should be the priority. However, that one trade, which would realistically yield us one player (probably), considering the org.‚Äôs aversion to luxury tax and the desire of other teams to fleece us if multiple players are involved, won‚Äôt save us. We still need multiple role players back, and the only realistic pathway to doing that still is via a Russell Westbrook trade. It‚Äôs mathematically impossible any other way.",1.0

I know he‚Äôs working with what he‚Äôs got, but there are games with questionable rotations and there are games with above average decisions. 

He hasn‚Äôt been shy to sub Russ out to close a game during nights that Russ struggles the first 3 quarters, I‚Äôll give him that, but he has not been consistent with it either. 

During our comeback tonight and before our 13pt lead, when we first got an 8 point lead, Ham signaled both LeBron and AD to take a breather and both of them said no. This led to us extending the lead by 5 more points with the consequence of LeBron and AD just being totally gassed. After seeing how much LeBron has been getting gassed with the extended mins, I feel like he should have forced them to sit for a minute (not at the same time). I know we were making a crazy run but adrenaline gets the best of the players up until they can‚Äôt play defense anymore. At that point as the coach, you can‚Äôt let the hype of the game get to you, every single min makes a difference when you only have 2 guys to rely on the whole game to get buckets.

Unless there‚Äôs a miraculous turnaround in the next couple months, or perhaps we somehow manage to turn things around next year, AD‚Äôs gone and I don‚Äôt have much doubt about it.

After AD‚Ä¶ what‚Äôs next? There are very few stars, let alone superstars, who want to come here anymore. We already know that almost no coaches want to come here after the Frank Vogel situation, and players aren‚Äôt just turning a blind eye to our front office‚Äôs blatant incompetence.

I made a post a while back saying we are in serious danger of becoming like the Knicks and got flamed to shit over it because you hiveminded zealots couldn‚Äôt understand what I was saying, instead blurting out ‚Äúdurrr they have no rings since the 70s durrr‚Äù.

Regardless of what we USED to be, this is who we are very possibly GOING TO be.

That is exactly the point we‚Äôre approaching. Once LeBron and probably AD are gone‚Ä¶ what‚Äôs left? The difference between us and the Knicks for so long was while we‚Äôre both big markets, we are known for success while they are known for wasting talent, hence why we still attracted big names more than they did, but now we don‚Äôt even have that. Oh and on top of that we‚Äôre growing a reputation of being cheap, so one more reason for guys to go to the Knicks instead.

The Lakers are one of very few sports organizations that had what I call an extended dynasty. This is where a front office is so good that they manage to cycle through multiple smaller dynasties with minimal turnaround. Us and the Celtics are really the only 2 franchises to do this, and none to the extent we did. The thing with this, however, is that the Lakers name isn‚Äôt the factor here, it was the consistent genius by the front office that got us where we were, and that‚Äôs gone.

NY Receives:PatBev, Nunn, Jones
Lakers Receives: Fournier, Reddish, 2 Second Round Picks

Sign Cousins and PJ Dozier

Why Dozier and Cousins? Dozier is currently in the G-League shooting over 40% from deep. I do not expect him to shoot that well going forward but he would be like 13 guy off the bench so it does not really matter. Cousins Played well towards the end of last year with the Nuggets. He is not there to eat massive minutes. Just enough to spell AD and be a big body in the middle that can bang with bigs for a while. 

Roster after the trade would be 
PG:Reaves, Westbrook, Schroder
SG:Walker, Fournier, Christie
SF:Reddish, Brown, Dozier
PF:Lebron, Gabriel, JTA
C: Davis, Bryant, Cousins

1) It ideal solves one of our biggest issues this year which is size and we instantly get much bigger. Entire starting 5 would be 6'4"" and up. I don‚Äôt think this makes us favorites but it makes us more dangerous. We don‚Äôt need a big to eat up massive minutes but we need to spell AD and not have any interior presence 

2) We gain 2 second round picks which we have been very good with drafting

3) Cam reddish is a restricted free agent and we would own bird rights. We could resign him to a 2 year contract with a team option the second year. 

4) We retain flexibility to bring back Lonnie, Reaves, Westbrook? Out of those 3 only real concern is Lonnie but it should work out money wise as long as you resign him first and then sign Reaves and Westbrook because of the arenas rule and bird rights for Westbrook
A) even if we move Westbrook later at the deadline for a Kuzma type piece we would have bird rights on him. 

5) Fournier contract really is not that bad after this season next year it‚Äôs an expiring 18m which is an asset.

2:  Kuz said he plays Bron and ADs positions, so he didn‚Äôt have the freedom offensively he has in Washington. I agree with this as well and think it would be a problem again for him as far as getting the shots and minutes he wants if he were to return. 

3: Pride. Lakers traded Kuz and included draft picks. If the lakers now trade for Kuz and and give up more picks, it‚Äôs essentially like giving up two first rounders to get the player they traded away back.It‚Äôs terrible optics for the Lakers front office. 
For Kuz, he‚Äôs in a contract year so he wants to have great looking stats heading into the off-season for a big deal. Washington gives him the opportunity to capitalize on stat stuffing while his minutes and scoring opportunities would go down in Los Angeles. 

4: I don‚Äôt think the lakers FO want to give up a pick for a player who already said he‚Äôs looking for a big long term contract this off-season. The lakers FO will not give him that contract. If that‚Äôs the case, the lakers see Kuz as a rental in their eyes, and,  because he alone would not nearly be enough to make the lakers championship contenders again, I don‚Äôt see the FO making this trade. He doesn‚Äôt really fill in many of the holes the lakers currently have in their roster.",1.0

Some of these names look bad but I'm trying to consider low investments with any means of improvements. I'm looking at 2nd string and low minute players that could maintain efficiency with higher minutes played. I'm also looking at younger players on rebuilding teams that look like they're not going to be involved in the future's of their franchises. I only looked at wings and bigs. I'm not a stats kind of guy but I do play Basketball GM so I still don't know what I'm talking about. Give me your thoughts on some of the players listed, do other advanced metrics really shit on these players or can they be viable options?

&amp;#x200B;

**Otto Porter Jr.**

**2 year 6 million dollar contract**

Career 39% shooter on 3 attempts a game

Career OBPM 1.0/ -0.9 this season

Career DBPM 0.8/ 1.6 this season

Career BPM 1.8/ 0.6 this season

Now why would we trade for an injured player that is potentially out for as long as Anthony Davis? He's on a cheap contract and his trade value is low compounded by the continued losing streak of the Raptors.  Potentially low investment and high reward if/when he comes back.

**Kevin Knox**

**2 Year 3 million dollar contract**

Career 34% shooter on 3 attempts a game/this season shooting 39% on three attempts a game

Career OBPM -2.8/ this season -0.4

Career DBPM -1.5/ this season 0.0

Career BPM -4.3/ this season -0.4

Now I know these numbers look bad right? Well you're right but on similar minutes played, Knox is playing better than Dennis Schroder with better shooting. He's improving and we need wings. An interesting tidbit that I read on the Piston's subreddit was a post praising the developmental ability of Dwayne Casey. It citied players like Blake Griffin, Jerami Grant, Trey Lyles, Bojan, and Alec Burks as improving their individual games.  How true is this? Idk, but I read it on reddit.

**Jalen McDaniels**

**1 year 1.9 Million dollar contract**

Career 36% shooter on 2 attempts a game/this season shooting 35% on three attempts a game

Career OBPM -2.3/ this season -1.8

Career DBPM -0.2/ this season 0.3

Career BPM -2.5/ this season -1.5

What do we need? Wings! When do we need them? Now!  Low investment higher potential wing. Shoots better than Cam Reddish and has better BPM scores for his career and for this season. Cam has never been an impact now player to me but McDaniels reeks of ""are you sure you want to put me in coach?"" The ceiling may be higher for reddish but the dumpster is right outside with Jalen McDaniels.

&amp;#x200B;

**Kelly Olynyk**

**2 Year 12.8 Million dollar contract**

Career 37% shooter on 3 attempts a game/this season shooting 43% on four attempts a game

Career OBPM 0.1/ this season 0.3

Career DBPM 0.8/ this season 0.8

Career BPM 0.9/ this season 1.1

Wow, another questionable/injured player on this list? You're goddamn right it is. Lack of ""bigs""ers can't be choosers. The most expensive big and player on this list. In my whole hour of research, I found it interesting that the bigs that can shoot the three were collectively more expensive then wings. Maybe it's his serviceable history or what, Kelly Olynyk is a fascinating player with a fascinating contract.

&amp;#x200B;

**Frank Kaminsky**

**1 year 1.8 Million dollar contract**

Career 36% shooter on 3 attempts a game/this season shooting 39% on three attempts a game

Career OBPM 0.0/ this season 1.5

Career DBPM -0.3/ this season 1.8

Career BPM -0.3/ this season 3.3

Frank 'the Tank' Kaminsky! I just want this guy because *Old School* is one of my favorite movies. Their isn't much to type about this guy besides the fact that he is tall and can shoot 3 pointers better than the average entirety of our team.

&amp;#x200B;

**Mo Bamba**

**2 Year 10 Million dollar contract**

Career 36% shooter on 3 attempts a game/this season shooting 39% on three attempts a game

Career OBPM -0.7/ this season 0.8

Career DBPM 0.9/ this season 0.3

Career BPM 0.3/ this season 1.1

My ""Kevin Youkilis"". Ok maybe there is no NBA equivalent to the Greek God of walks but this guy is legitimately what we've been searching for complementing Anthony Davis and Lebron James. He hasn't lived up to his Rudy Gobert comparison but has somewhat become a 3 point shooting Nerlens Noel.  This guy is what I would consider the priority with Anthony Davis going down.

&amp;#x200B;

Conclusion: It hurt me to find and write out these players. What hurt me even more was that some of these players were better than players on our own roster in terms of BPM. This Westbrook problem is in my eyes the problem of small market MLB teams. You gotta find cheap efficient players. Outside of Lebron, Davis, and Westbrook, you got 39 million to trade for 3 and D. Am I against trading for Buddy Hield , Cam Reddish, Demar Derozan, and Gordon Hayward? Yes, but I am only against trading for them at certain prices. Am I against trading for Myles Turner, Kyrie Irving, and Bojan Bogdanovic? Of course not but I don't really believe they are attainable pieces. Who knows though, I lost pretty hard in fantasy football this year so my player evaluations may be flawed.",1.0

It‚Äôs hard to find any closure‚Ä¶when we don‚Äôt actually know what‚Äôs happening.

On the one hand - every report since Sunday has painted this bleak, mysterious, and eery situation where Davis will miss extended time beyond the initial 1 month estimation. I‚Äôve read comments here and on r/nba suggesting that he may be done for the year.

Now on the other hand, what we do know is what our eyes have shown us. AD gets injured but plays through the half of the nuggets game. He scored on multiple occasions and, if my memory serves, I believe he even had a dunk at some pt following the injury. Contrast this with the 1) MCL sprain against Minnesota (where McDaniels falls into him) where we feared AD tore something and the estimate there was at least four weeks AND 2) falling on Goberts foot causing the foot sprain where the estimate was also around 4 weeks and he immediately needed help getting off the court. Not to mention, he was on the bench for the wizards game with no boot and no noticeable limp and apparently on the bench for the Phoenix game (I saved myself the pain and didn‚Äôt watch so i can‚Äôt comment on if he had a limp).

I really have no clue what to make of this. The optimist within me says that none of the reporters have a clue because we literally don‚Äôt know, but the pessimist within me says this is taking too long so it has to be awful.


Edit: also adding, it‚Äôs odd that nothing regarding AD came up during the postgame today with Darvin? Don‚Äôt wanna think too much either way on this but that should be noted",0.84

Over the past few weeks, there‚Äôs been a palpable feeling across various parts of the franchise of a disconnect over LaVine‚Äôs situation in Chicago",HeroGolem3,"Excerpts:

&gt; The Bulls have held multiple team meetings to try to work out their issues, and that has included one-on-one, face-to-face sitdowns between DeRozan and LaVine, multiple sources with direct knowledge who were granted anonymity because they are unauthorized to speak publicly on the matter have told The Athletic. DeRozan and LaVine have always had a strong mutual respect for each other. Only 10 months ago, over All-Star Weekend in Cleveland, the stars proclaimed themselves as the NBA‚Äôs best duo. They maintain a good personal relationship. But their meetings have not led to in-game results so far, with a level of on-court, stylistic tension simply festering throughout the season and being magnified due to the win-loss record.

&gt; Multiple league sources and sources close to the organization say LaVine and the Bulls are not seeing eye-to-eye. Over the past few weeks, there‚Äôs been a palpable feeling across various parts of the franchise of a disconnect over LaVine‚Äôs situation in Chicago

&gt; DeRozan joined the Bulls on a three-year, $85 million deal in 2021 and will be eligible for an extension this summer worth a maximum of four years and $153.7 million. Do the Bulls view DeRozan as a centerpiece for years to come?

As Raptors executives Masai Ujiri and Bobby Webster strolled between the two courts in Mandalay Bay‚Äôs Convention Center, speculation surrounded the long-term future of one of Toronto‚Äôs rotation players.

According to numerous NBA executives who spoke with HoopsHype at the G League Showcase, the top Raptors trade candidate is unanimously Gary Trent Jr.

The current belief from those executives is Trent Jr. will opt out of his $18.8 million player option and enter unrestricted free agency this summer. Two executives told HoopsHype they believe Trent could earn $20 million or more if he entered unrestricted free agency. There‚Äôs skepticism amongst several front offices across the league that Toronto would be willing to retain Trent Jr. if he eclipses the $20 million annual range.

Recently, Trent Jr. was more efficient coming off the bench during a seven-game stretch where he averaged 18.3 points while shooting 49.5 percent from the field and 39.2 percent from downtown for a 117 offensive rating.

I can see Minney doing that kinda deal of the affinity they have for Bev. Tauren Prince makes 7 mill. Either one of those guys would be what this team needs.

In a sense I think its best to make smaller deals to keep team identity and chemistry over going for big name stars.",1.0

Just out of curiosity, I remember several months ago that the Lakers and a few other teams were looking to pick up Tyreke Evans (after he got reinstated back into the league). Time went on and it sort of slipped my mind until now. Watching the game last night brought up memories of past Kings players, and immediately I went ""Oh yeah, where the hell is Evans these days? What happened to him?""


I YouTube searched some recent videos of him from over the off-season training and doing open gym games. Looks healthy and able to play. Still only 33yo and he has experienced PG skills as a scorer and facilitator. Plus he has actual size at PG to defend and switch. Just curious if anyone else had wondered why Evans hasn't been getting a look. Is he that cooked? Even Isaiah Thomas got a few more chances to play in the league before Evans did. He surely has to be better than Beverly and Nunn, right?",1.0

Anthony Davis, after playing the best basketball we've seen from him since the bubble, is unsurprisingly hurt again. Out indefinitely. It is painfully obvious at this point he will not be able to stay healthy. Historically, big men do not age well and he's been dealing with injury issues his entire career. It will likely only get WORSE moving forward, with his production likely dropping too.

His contract runs through the 24-25 season..

LeBron James has just this season left on his contract, though he is ""expected"" to sign for another 2 years.

Russell Westbrooks contract is up after this season.

Salvation via free agency is very unlikely, considering the best free agents coming up in 2023 are:  
\- Khris Middleton (Cannot see him leaving the Bucks)  
\- James Harden (Cannot see him leaving Philly or signing with the Lakers)  
\- Kyrie Irving (Don't see him leaving KD, but if he did we do know what he and LeBron can do together)  
\- Kristaps Porzingis (Another injury prone big)

If it's me, I'm looking to trade Anthony Davis along with our picks and anyone else, to get a star level player to pair with Bron. If no team will go for that, then we go for a fringe star level player that has youth, health, and potential.

If LeBron doesn't like that, then we work to respectfully move on from both him and AD and get as many picks and prospects as possible, and we fully begin the rebuild process.

Then I use the rest of the available money I have to fill out the roster with players who aren't Kendrick Nunn or Patrick Beverly.

Yeah, it's a damn shame that this isn't working out with Bron and AD, but they did win a championship together, that's special. But it's time to move on from AD. If that means Bron has to go, so be it.

Now that we got that out the way, you must be ignorant if you don‚Äôt think this front office forcing 36+ minute games on a 38 year old in year 20 has done nothing but fucked up to build out the roster or fix it marginally. 

Before you say, ‚ÄúOh but freeeecurry‚ÄùBron had the option to sign the extension‚Äù, no he was lied to and manipulated into thinking the lakers brass would use the picks to be competitive. 

Their main intention of signing Bron was to have Bron break the scoring record as a laker, this is equivocal to a chip for Jeannie and a big enough moral victory in order her to justify to continue not spending marginal amounts of money so AD, Lebron, and Russ all end their careers sooner than they should have because Jeannie decided to run them into the ground Thibbs style. 

Now we have proof that she is just running players into the ground instead of just fixing the roster even marginally. She can‚Äôt even cut Damian to bring someone in who can actually rebound and give AD help. 

I and all other fans should place the cumulative blame on to Jeannie and raise awareness.

Last night Russ was +8 and Lebron was -6 but you‚Äôd think according to the fan base it were the opposite. Lebron is stuck playing with a worthless 1-3 trio and a 5 costar who‚Äôs injured,Freeeecurry,"This is by no means an attack on Lebron, he single-handedly took over in the 4th but it‚Äôs an objective perspective to counter his stans. 

The starting lineup has been designed to enable Lebron and create spacing, not necessarily ensure team wins.
Last night Bev and Dennis were both -8 individually and more interestingly in less than 9 minutes played TBJ was an atrocious -11.

Bron finished -6 even after the takeover in the 4th which speaks volumes in how bad the starting lineup is due to the trio of Lonnie, Bev, and Dennis. Dennis is allergic to creating. He has no business starting

As things currently stand Russ is the best playmaker on the team and the best floor raiser for the bigs and spacing with his ability to crash the lane and find open guys on the perimeter especially reaves.

The best lineup yesterday was a combination of Russ, Lebron, reaves, and wenyen yet ham went back to Dennis and Bev in the clutch.

The truth is Dennis is doing nothing to make lebrons role easier, he brings the ball up court and hands it off to Bron on screens where Bron usually settles for a jumper.

In contrast when Russ plays with pace we open up transition baskets and make it that much easier for Lebron to score. In fact this team as constructed is only good when playing with pace and in transition.

The issue is, if we‚Äôre seeing this surely ham and his staff are so it begs to ask you wtf is really going on?",1.0

But I think it‚Äôs important to know that this sub is grossly exaggerating how poor of a job he‚Äôs done. He‚Äôs really only had one big mistake, and the culpability is shared there.

He traded the baby lakers for AD and built a title team. That was a win that year. I‚Äôll admit that there is the question of whether injury prone AD and Lebron win the title that year without a 3 month break in the middle of the season. But they won in the conditions that were present. So a win.

The next year, pelinka retooled the team, and yes they lost in the first round to the suns, but that was more so a byproduct of Lebron and ad being injured. Pelinka put together a good team that at one point was the number one seed in the west and looked like the best team in the nba. If the league had another 3 month break this year, they probably win. Regardless, it was a good team until injuries took out their two best players. Injuries were the reason that season was a failure, not Pelinka.

The year after that they overreact and bring in Westbrook. This was a poor move, but let‚Äôs not pretend that it was Pelinka‚Äôs sole decision. Lebron, AD, and Westbrook got together for that famous meeting before the trade happened, and all these reports came out about how it was Lebron and AD who were pushing for this trade. This would fit Lebron‚Äôs schtick, since ever since Miami, this is how he tries to win titles. He tries to trade young players and role players for veteran star players to fast pass a title the super team way. He just fucked up this time. But this failure isn‚Äôt entirely on Pelinka and is as much a byproduct of him listening to his star players‚Äô desires.

This season looks to be lousy as well, and the lakers are on track to miss the playoffs. But wtf do you expect him to do? The lakers pay his checks, not Lebron. His loyalty is to the lakers. Westbrook comes off the books after this season. I‚Äôm not sure trading away future assets and mortgaging the future to a 38 year old player who has been hurt every season he‚Äôs been in LA except when he got a 3 month break is the best option. Ditto for AD. Is this guy really it? He played out of his mind for 2 weeks. But it wasn‚Äôt like he was playing 46 mins a game like old Kobe before he tore his Achilles. Dude literally was playing 36 mins a game and broke his foot via air. What evidence in the last few years is there to suggest that Lebron and AD will even be healthy come playoff time to convince Pelinka to mortgage the future for two injury prone players, one of whom is 38?

The smart option is to punt this season, let Westbrook walk, and see what can happen with his money off the books. I got news for you: fucking buddy hield and Myles turner aren‚Äôt making this team a championship contender. There aren‚Äôt really any options here for Pelinka to make.",1.0

&amp;#x200B;

**Can you generate a short story about Kobe Bryant meeting Pac-Man?**

Kobe Bryant was a legendary basketball player who had achieved great success and fame during his career. One day, while training in the gym, he heard a strange noise coming from outside. He went to investigate and was shocked to find a large yellow dot bouncing around the court.

The dot introduced itself as Pac-Man, and Kobe was intrigued. He asked Pac-Man what he was doing in the gym, and the dot explained that he was on a journey to find the lost city of gold and needed help. Kobe was intrigued by the idea and decided to join Pac-Man on his quest.

So, together, Kobe and Pac-Man ventured deep into the jungle, encountering many strange and dangerous creatures along the way. Eventually, they stumbled across the lost city, but it was guarded by a mysterious force. In order to gain access to the city, Kobe and Pac-Man had to prove themselves worthy.

Kobe used his basketball skills to impress the guard and gain access to the city, and together, he and Pac-Man explored the lost city and discovered its many secrets. They eventually found the powerful artifact that Pac-Man had been searching for, and with it, they were able to make their way back home.

&amp;#x200B;

**What was the artifact?**

The artifact that Pac-Man was searching for in the temple was a powerful object with mysterious powers. It was said to be able to grant any wish, and the ghosts were guarding it to make sure it didn't fall into the wrong hands.

&amp;#x200B;

**What happened to Kobe and Pac-Man once they went home?**

Once Kobe and Pac-Man returned home, Kobe was able to use the artifact to make his wildest dreams come true. He used its power to become a famous basketball player and make a name for himself. As for Pac-Man, he was able to find the lost city of gold and use its wealth to become a famous explorer.

Kobe and Pac-Man remained close friends and often went on adventures together to explore the world and uncover its many secrets. They also used the artifact to make wishes come true for those in need, and in doing so, brought joy to many people around the world.

&amp;#x200B;

**Kobe Bryant was already a famous basketball player - it wouldn't make sense he became one after.**

That's true - Kobe Bryant was already a famous basketball player when he embarked on his quest with Pac-Man. However, the artifact enabled him to take his career to the next level. He was able to use its power to become an even more successful and renowned basketball player, and he was able to use the fame and recognition he gained to help those in need.

&amp;#x200B;

**But you said he used its power ""to become a famous basketball player"" - he was already famous. How could he use its power to become famous if he was already famous?**

Kobe Bryant was already a famous basketball player, but he was not yet a legend. The power of the artifact enabled him to take his career to the next level and become an even more successful and renowned basketball player. He was able to use the fame and recognition he gained to help those in need, and he was able to use it to inspire others with his story.",1.0

||* NOP can choose either 2024 or 2025 pick, LAL keeps the opposite||

**Stepien Rule**

Due to the [Stepien Rule](https://basketball.realgm.com/article/249279/CBA-Encyclopedia-Stepien-Rule) we can currently only trade the 2027 and 2029 first round picks. A team can not trade away all of their future first round picks in two consecutive drafts. See the comments for more detailed explanation. (u/Awesomefan09 and u/Zodraz)


**Future Salary Cap**

|**Year**|**No. of players**|**Est. Cap Hit**|
:--|:--|:--|
|2023-24|4*|$91.7 mil|
|2024-25|2**|$93.8 mil|

|2028-29|0|$0|
|2029-30|0|$0|
||||
||* Jones is a Player Option||
||** James and Davis are player options||

Long story short, we have pretty good draft coverage, effectively only missing one first round pick over the next 7 years. And on the salary cap side, we have no long term 'bad' contracts, so we have flexibility there as well. 

Obviously this all depends on our front office making good decisions, which most seem skeptical of. But I do want to remind everyone that we generally have good scouting. And we had really good rosters in both 19-20 and 20-21, before the Westbrook trade. The Westbrook trade is really the only major black eye, imo. No, Caruso is not worth paying $30 mil in luxury taxes on, sorry, and I say that absolutely loving the guy. 

Personally, I don't think the the future is bleak, I think we've done a good job ensuring that we can rebuild once LeBron retires.

To keep this team as 'playoffs' caliber team, AD needs to play majority of games which will cause him an injury for some reason.

Not a single wing besides lebron who can shoot or score by themselves. I already expected this ending when our front office literally said before this season ""We are considering Pat and Reaves as 3&amp;D guys."" PELINKA, 6 2 GUYS AINT THE WINGS. THEY ARE GUARDS.

I follow the Lakers when i can because the chase for Kareem is huge, and it will be monumental when lebron gets there.

But it is clear to me that lebron is only chasing that record.   There is not a lot of effort on lebrons part in leading or putting the effort into the small things that are necessary to win games.  To be honest, the Lakers are a hard team to watch (sorry).

The franchise really is in limbo until lebron gets that record.

Until that time, the most entertaining aspect of the Lakers is austin reaves imo. He is fun to watch because he needs to be creative to make up for his lack of athleticism.  I can't speak to AD because he is mostly injured. You can't entertain sitting on the bench.  When Reaves gets taken off the court, I instinctively start to channel surf for another game.   He is the only thing that makes watching the Lakers play, tolerable.

4422,2022-12-26 04:47:41,zvfat2,"Even if you think the season is lost, we should still clean house on the guards",suhar97,"The trio of Beverly, Nunn, and Westbrook is the source of all of our woes 

1) awful fits given the size, lack of 2 way presence, lack of consistent outside shooting 

2) relative to each of their contracts, they are all underperforming and they are 3 of the 4 non-vet min, non-Bron / AD players 

Point 2 is critical when you add in an injured AD (max cap slot). This boils down to Lebron playing with a vet min roster and guys performing under relative to their contracts. The development of a guy like AR very partially can offset a fraction of this issue, but it is clearly not enough. When AD was healthy, he is the freak type of player that also helps to offset this issue. Right now, the ship is sinking

Now, even if you believe the season is cooked, there is a case to be made to clean house of these 3: continuity

These 3 would be ~65m of expiring salary, and would be enough to restock the cupboard with 3-4 quality role players. This requires moving both picks inevitably (more on that below)

Contrast this with letting them expire and maybe you have ~30m in cap and get 1-2 guys? You end up with another deficient roster with now hardly any moveable deals, as the lakers suck on the margins with bird rights. Yes you may have a 3rd pick to use, but russ‚Äô contract is the best vehicle of replenishing the roster at 47m. Without it, those 3 picks become far harder to consolidate into immediate value

Trading the 3 allows you to build a mini core for at minimum this year and next. Championship rosters are not assembled over night and the 2020 team was the exception, not the rule. So even if you think this year is cooked, you allow ad and Bron to mesh with this hypothetical set of role players and see what they can do this year and buckle down for next year.

In the most upside case, the roller players you trade for now see increase in value and down the line before a rebuild you can firesale and recoup your assets that you invested right now",1.0

I imagine LeBron wants a trade this off-season of which I wouldn‚Äôt blame him for wanting. However, this would not be possible without the extension and he would‚Äôve walked for free. At the very least we can get some pieces to rebuild in return for delivering LeBron-level revenue to another team that wants to contend. In a league where the fresh crop of great talent (Ja, Trae, Tatum, BI, etc) are coming into their own, we need to make moves to keep up or be lost in the shadows for years while those legacies play out. We might be able to have our cake (the bubble chip) and eat it (a new young crop of talent). With WB‚Äôs contract and AD possibly wanting out, we will have stupid money next year to start a relatively fast rebuild especially with younger talent in shitty markets that are getting impatient with their FO‚Äôs inability to help them win a chip. I just hope the Celtics don‚Äôt win a chip in the process lol.

Feel free to circle jerk your frustration about this season but face it, we ain‚Äôt winning shit. Do we gamble for a chip next season or do we make moves with our remaining big pieces? And before you say people won‚Äôt wanna come to the Lakers because of how we treated LeBron, remind yourself that he was given pretty insane privileges in the construction of the team AND it‚Äôs the Lakers‚Ä¶ in Los Angeles‚Ä¶ just look at how Kuz is still a spokesman even after getting ripped on by the fans and playing in the shadow of LeBron and AD.

If he's not going to play Damian (which I don't blame him, that guy is lost of the floor), are you going to tell me we couldn't use Huff in some bench minutes and to spread the floor a bit more?

LBJ is finally saying what I've been saying this entire year... Ham doesn't know how to make second half counter adjustments, and anticipate opponent adjustments. I mean, he's really, really bad in this area, and it's cost the Lakers a lot of W's this year. A sign of a good coach, is how you come out in the second half as a team.

Disclaimer: I wasn't a fan of firing Vogel. Vogel is clearly a good coach, and like ANY coach in the entire NBA, has his weaknesses. But people in here think he was either bad, or average... which is a complete joke, because he's been called by his peers a genius on defense, knows how to get guys to play together, and ran a decent offense by putting the ball in his best playmakers hands and placing guys in the best situations to succeed.

He lost the locker room last year, I think mainly because of WB. But firing him and hiring an even worst HC, wasn't the answer.

But offensively he has developed so much skills compare to last season.

He has been one of the best to draw fouls, pull up jumpshots, and floaters during crunch time. Nowadays, its not surprising to see him score over 20 points.

His playmaking is also better than poole, clarkson when he was playing as sixth man and Tyler herro.

He is averaging 11 points with 39% from 3 pointer and 52% from the field. Maybe he can be 16-17 points scorer on average next year and probably 19-20 points scorer if he gets more minutes.

LeBron signed an extension based on a very public promise from Pelinka that he would do whatever it takes, including trading future picks, to put together a winning team while LeBron was on the roster.  So far they have done NOTHING!   Actually they've done worse than that.  

Besides the awful Westbrook trade (that no GM worth his salt would have made), they let Caruso (who was willing to take a pay cut to stay) go to avoid paying luxury tax.  They put together a roster that makes no sense in the modern NBA.  A roster full of guards that can't shoot.   They passed on a Heild and Turner trade, two guys that can still contribute.

4640,2022-12-31 07:09:20,zzo621,Two Trades I still think are very possible and give the Lakers a legit shot at a championship (assuming AD returns and we make the playoffs),BBaron08,"1. RWB &amp; 2027 1st for Myles Turner &amp; Buddy Hield. We can throw in a 2nd if we need. 

Why do the Lakers do it? 

If our front office has learned anything at all, anything, we cannot continue AD at the 5 for long stretches. He is an absolute monster, but fragile and we need to accept that. He has openly stated he likes playing the 4. Just like in 2020, we absolutely abused teams with McGee &amp; Howard at Center and AD at the 4. Turner gives us a shot blocker in the paint and allows AD to play free safety as he did in 2020 and save his body a bit along with not having to be our sole paint presence on defense. Myles is also shooting 40%+ from 3 this year. He isn't some knock down shooter, good enough to where he won't totally clog the paint. Buddy Hield is a top 5 shooter in the game. An absolute traffic cone on defense, but again, adding Turner in my mind is a net positive on defense. Buddy is probably the best floor spacer we can add to our roster. 

Why do the Pacers do it?

Simple. You cannot lose Turner for nothing in free agency. In my mind a Lakers 2027 1st has serious value. In 5 years time, our beloved Bron will be 43 and AD will be 34. Nobody knows what will happen but good chance we will be in a re-tool phase ourselves so the Pacers may end up with a lottery pick here. They also get a massive expiring in WB, and can free up major cap in 2023 as they continue to build around Mathurin and Halliburton. Turner also practically posted on twitter for us to trade for him. If he can play his cards right again, and force the Pacers hand maybe we can get away without giving up a ton.

2. Nunn &amp; 2029 1st for Saddiq Bey

I know the focus has been on Bogi, but apparently Bey may be coming available in trade talks. If he does become available, he is the perfect wing, and per Jake Fischer, the Pistons want an unprotected 1st. I would try and add top 5 protections. He's 23, plays solid D and can score in bunches. At 6'8, if we do the Turner trade, our potential starting line-up goes to:

LBJ, Hield, Bey, AD, Turner. We go from midgets to monsters as we were in 2020.",1.0

Our first priority should be a rim protecting center who could maybe stretch the floor a little bit. Getting a Center like that would allow Thomas Bryant to be our backup 5 and dominate against other bench bigs. We would also see more minutes for Lebron at the 3 allowing quality starting wing minutes.,1.0

Damned if you do, and damned if you don‚Äôt huh if you‚Äôre ham? 

We saw Lebron single-handedly deliver us that victory and although Russ had an overall average to good game his layup and steal on Dejounte Murray in the clutch were huge.

However one overlooked part was how Russ was sent out there to make the Lebron takeover easier as he‚Äôs the only ball handler on this team capable of both handling the ball and getting it to Lebron no matter where his positioning is on the court, and that‚Äôs exactly what happened last night. Russ went out there and got Lebron the ball, in the spots Lebron wanted it and that added chemistry has not only proven effective thus far but disproven that Russ and Bron can‚Äôt share the court

Lebrons off ball play has been phenomenal and efficient, and Russ has done great finding Lebron in less effective defensive schemes

Often to start games Lebron is forced to iso and take less efficient shots because of the lack of a real playmaker. 

And to all you echo chambering the playoffs narrative, no team can guard rotations where you have 48 minutes of Lebron-Ad Lebron-Russ and Russ-Ad because you‚Äôll always have Lebron and Russ there to break down defenses as they have been.",1.0

1. Buddy Hield is this era's own version of a mixture of Kyle Korver and Ray Allen. He's a true specialist and he's a cold cold man. There's no chance that a Ray Allen or a Kyle Korver will turn into a dud on any team. Lebron will find this man just like the good old days; and he will hit 3's as often, addressing the issue of Lakers shooting woes.

2. Myles Turner is exactly what AD needs right now, with Myles at center, AD can go back to 4 and save AD a little bit from wear and tear until playoffs. A Davis and Turner version of twin towers will augment Lakers team defense a hundred folds, they will seal the rim which will help our guys in the perimeter to defend more efficiently and effectively. In short, we will regain our short comings on the defensive end, it might not be as potent and impenetrable defense of the legendary Lakers 2020 Champs, but it's more than enough to compete even against the upper echelon of the league.

These two is the antidote to turning everything around. Get these two now and we're back on track.",1.0

Full stats here. Was looking at net ratings without Anthony Davis. In all seriousnessÔºå most lineups work with AD healthy.

So first principles: Lonnie great on offense but bad D. Pat Bev spot up shooter and great D. Russ and Schroeder are both mainly POA defenders but not great help defenders. Both have similar offensive games that play off each other.

So the net ratings don't lie. Lonnie with Russ and/or Schroeder just leads to bad defense. Lonnie gets lost too much. Both Russ and Schroeder are POA defenders and can't make up for Lonnie's mistakes.

So Ham needs to stop that. Just play Schroeder and Russ together.

Pat Bev is perfect though. He takes charges and plays help defense. He also can stop POA. So he makes up for all of Lonnie's mistakes on D. It's one of the few positive net rating lineups without AD.

Never seen Wenyen so energized when Russ probably had 3-4 turnovers trying to pass it to him. It keeps Wenyen energized to keep cutting and trying to catch the ball and make plays.

Same goes for Nunn, Schroeder, Thomas Bryant and crew. They know Russ will be the guy willing to risk turnovers to force feed the ball. It makes the guys feel they should keep moving off ball and cutting.

Now we don't need 48 minutes of this. And it's a good change of pace from Lebron's free lance offense. Just wanted to call it out.

I still see a lot of doubters and naysayers almost reminding me of the 2020 season lol a healthy Lebron &amp; AD have shown they are arguably the best duo in the league and with a decent supporting cast, they are very good. We have already beaten some very good teams and have been competitive in most games we‚Äôve played halfway through the soon so far. The way we are perceived is fair considering our horrible start to the season but with how much change our team had including new coach, lots of roster turnover and key injuries to Schroeder and TB, it‚Äôs understandable we started slow but now we‚Äôre picking it up. Once we get AD healthy and Reaves back, we have a good shot at climbing in the standings and being a top 4-5 seed by end of the season. Add to that, a trade for a wing *might* be made in the next month, it‚Äôs looking up for us bois. Just gotta hope our big dawgs can stay healthy.",1.0

4938,2023-01-11 08:08:39,108zevu,Dispelling the notion that this team is refusing to make a trade in order to reset the repeater tax,BrianC_,"I see it mentioned often here that this team is refusing to make a trade or take on more salary because they are afraid of the repeater tax.  Now, I'm not saying that the team won't make moves to reset the repeater tax -- I actually think that's fairly likely and mentioned it years ago.  I'm making this topic to show that the idea that they won't make a trade because of the repeater tax is just not accurate.

In order to do this, I will look at the hypothetical math of the deal so many people mention when discussing the team's reluctance to make a trade, the Myles Turner and Buddy Hield deal.  Below is the relevant data for the off-season if such a trade is made --

#Projected Roster

Player Name | Cap amount
:-- | :-- 
LeBron James | $46.9m
Anthony Davis | $40.6m
Buddy Hield | $19.3m
Max Christie | $1.7m
*Total payroll* | *$108.5m*
*Luxury tax cut-off* | *$162m*
*Luxury tax cut-off - payroll* | *$53.5m*

&amp;nbsp;

#Cap-holds

Player Name | Cap amount
:-- | :-- 
Myles Turner | $27m
Austin Reaves | $2.1m
Wenyen Gabriel | $1.9m

&amp;nbsp;

#Relevant exceptions

Exception Name | Cap amount
:-- | :--
Non tax-payer MLE | $11.4m
Veteran minimum exception | $2m
Undrafted rookie minimum exception | $1.1m

&amp;nbsp;

*There is also an additional first-round-pick cap-hold of ~$2.3m as well as additional cap-holds for empty-roster spots.*

*Damian Jones does have a player-option for next season, but in the event where he opts-in, I am assuming the team would salary dump him.*

&amp;nbsp;

So, what do all these numbers mean?

The first number is the projected space under the luxury cut-off of $53.5m  The team will have that much money to re-sign Turner, re-sign any other players they intend to keep like Reaves, and fill out the roster with exceptions.

First, Myles Turner.  The biggest problem and likely the real reason for why the deal wasn't made is that Turner is an expiring contract and a potential half-season rental that needs to be re-signed.  Because the team has traded so many assets for him, it would be a disaster to let him walk.  As such, he'll have the leverage to ask for as much money as he wants with the threat that if the Lakers FO doesn't agree, he'll walk and leave them to deal with the massive blow-back of spending multiple FRPs for just a few months of Turner.  This is normally why half-season rental deals don't cost much.

I'm not going to assume that Turner hard-balls the team for a $40m+ AAV max length contract.  That would be a fucking disaster.  I'm going to assume that in such a scenario, the team would instead opt to let him walk and instead convert his contract with another team into a sign-and-trade.  So, we'll assume that Turner or the trade-exception received in a sign-and-trade and subsequently used would cost $30m.

That leaves the team with $23.5m before hitting the luxury cut-off.  Assuming the team decides to keep Reaves at a value of $11.4m which has been mentioned in certain reports (though I personally don't believe he'll be paid that much), that brings the team to 7 empty roster spots with $12.1m to fill them.  That could be filled with a 20ish selection FRP, 3 veteran minimums, and 3 undrafted rookies/SRPs (I believe the team has 2 SRPs).  In this scenario, in order to avoid the luxury cut-off, the team would potentially not use their MLE aside from signing their SRPs.

#Final Roster

Player Name | Cap amount
:-- | :-- 
LeBron James | $46.9m
Anthony Davis | $40.6m
Myles Turner | $30m
Buddy Hield | $19.3m
Austin Reaves | $11.4m
Max Christie | $1.7m
First-round pick | ~$2.3m
Veteran minimum exception | $2m
Veteran minimum exception | $2m
Veteran minimum exception | $2m
Undrafted rookie or SRP | $1.1m
Undrafted rookie or SRP | $1.1m
Undrafted rookie or SRP | $1.1m
*Total payroll* | *$161.5*
*Luxury tax cut-off* | *$162m*

&amp;nbsp;

Even in this example, there is some room for more flexibility.  First, there is the possibility that Turner doesn't get $30m.  Second, there is the possibility that Reaves doesn't get $11.4m.  On top of that, Buddy Hield could also be moved for slightly less salary.  The point is that even if the final numbers seem tight, there is still a lot of workable space under the luxury cut-off.

So, in reality, even if a trade is made, the team can still field a roster next season that is under the luxury tax cut-off.  And, in my opinion, that roster might not even be that bad if the FO can continue to find good value with FRP/SRPs and minimum exceptions.  Do I think they should and hope they will just pay the extra tax?  Yea.  I think if you bring back Wenyen with his early-bird rights and use the full MLE, that roster is still a potential contender with the right pick-ups at the minimum.",1.0

Recently, a rumor came out that LeBron will request a trade at the end of the season. He did not bother to confirm it nor deny it. This has been the case for any LeBron career rumor for the entirety of his career. When rumors came out at the star of the 09-10 season that LeBron might go for Chicago or Miami, no word from the King. Same can be said when rumors buzzed in the middle of the 13-14 season when the Heat were losing a step. This was also true at the end of the 16-17 season when rumors started that he might go to LA. Now, with that said. Expect a major rebuild in the off-season, my friends. AD will probably request a trade to Chicago. Bron is probably going to Cleveland or Phoenix. I just hope we get some good assets back. It was a good run. They got a chip for Kobe and I think that alone is something we should be thankful to Bron and AD for.

Despite controversial refs the last two games came down to a bucket and lack of prep. Good teams learn from there mistakes bad teams keep falling. Its good if you win and 2 of the wins on the win streak were close wins. However, I feel the staff has to learn and work with the players every practice what to do in clutch situations. They gotta be schematic and not revert to hero ball. When your dealing with older players you have to find other ways to dominate. You cannot rely on LeBron to bail you out anymore he's getting older and clearly while still great not as bullet proof as he was 5-10 yrs ago.

Practice makes perfect and something tells me this team doesn't practice nearly enough. Theres a lack of structure for a coach who preaches discipline. If you have a real system and plan guys will go out and execute. When you mess up in one game your job is to learn how to not repeat mistakes it isn't rocket science.",1.0

5071,2023-01-16 14:16:30,10dfmpp,Prediction for rest of the season,ThunderClown101,"The Lakers are 19-24 and are in the start of the toughest schedule part. 

It‚Äôs the worst time of the year to be missing 4 main rotation players‚Ä¶ 

If Reaves, Walker, AD and Beverly don‚Äôt come back soon things look very grim for the Lakers.

Tomorrow is Houston - it‚Äôs fine, but after that the schedule is incredibly tough‚Ä¶

Kings, Grizzlies, Blazers, Clippers in a 6 days stretch. 

They way this team is being coached it‚Äôs very hard to see them dominating any of these games if opposition is healthy. Meanwhile our coach has showed us that he is not capable of making smart decisions and adjustments to win close games.

And then we have an easy one in Spurs, after which we go on another tough run on the road. 

Celtics, Nets, Knicks, Pacers in 6 days as well. 

Let‚Äôs just imagine the Lakers go .500 against these teams and win 2 easy games against the Rockets and Spurs. 

They could end up with a 25-28 record with 29 games left in the season. 

However we should also consider the fact that LeBron will not play in every game, because there are 3 games in 4 nights twice and he is 38. 

Let‚Äôs assume he misses 2 games. 

My guess is that the Lakers are going to be 25-30 and will have 29 games to make the play-ins. 

They would need to go 17 and 12 to just finish at the .500 mark.

Hopefully they will be healthy for that final stretch of games, but nonetheless making a trade only makes sense to acquire quality role players to extend them this summer. 

Because if you make the trade to drastically improve the roster it‚Äôd be very difficult to go 17-12 with a brand new team. 

It‚Äôs seems that this season is on the verge of being completely lost. Best case scenario is making the play-in as 9-10 seeds which would require winning a lot of close games. Darvin Ham is a bad coach for this mission.

It would require a miracle run and lots of luck for the Lakers to get the 6-8 seeds. If that happens then there a chance that a healthy Lakers team can make some noise against young unproven teams like the Grizzlies or Pelicans in round 1.",1.0
5072,2023-01-16 14:37:27,10dg3xz,Earlier this season Darvin Ham called a timeout in between the free throws of his own player. His complete lack of awareness to why and how timeout are used is telling that he is in over his head.,CutLonzosHair2017,"Everyone watched the Philly game. But this isn't a minor issue. The type of mistakes he's making with timeouts is they type of mistakes a rec coach would make.

The timeout from the title showed such a lack of awareness about coaching but it has not been the only one. He also ran 5 minutes of game clock one game with AD at the scorers table waiting to check in without calling a time out. The other team went on a massive run and because he did not call a time out, AD played 2 minutes in the second quarter. And that was not purposeful as AD was waiting to check in for 5 minutes...

This is not me trying to bury Ham off of one incident. He's been bad all season. The 5 guard lineup. Having Westbrook and LeBron sit while PatBev played PG every 3rd quarter for the first 10ish games. Out of timeout plays routinely ending in a contested 3 for bad 3 point shooters. 

Vogel wasn't perfect. And there were hints that he had lost the locker room. But replacing him with an unknown was a mistake. And it was the same mistake that the Lakers made with Luke Walton.",1.0

There's only a few teams I'm comfortable with letting whatever happens happens. Golden State  Brooklyn Miami Chicago.

There's atleast 1 common theme with the teams I mentioned they either have set closing groups or they have professional shot makers. In the case of Golden State they flourish in chaos and they move without the ball so that throws defenses in a bind.

The other teams I mentioned have professional tough shot makers KD Kyrie Jimmy Derozan. They can get to THEIR spot on the floor and get off the shot they want at all times.

The problem I have with the decision making with Darvin is that there's no plan. If you don't wanna use a timeout cool call out a set off the rebound. Or at the very least have a organized plan or rules you imply off of that scenario.

Why wasn't the spacing rules implied with 2 in the corner 1 in the dunker 2 at top. You could have called a simple dribble handoff where Russ hands the ball off to Lebron Wenyen sprints to the top Lebron goes down hill.",1.0

5116,2023-01-17 13:22:49,10ec5jb,Millionth trade proposal - my realistic dream trade,mxj7,"Let me start with this : With Westbrook's recent display, I think for the short term there's more upside in trading Pat + Nunn (and eventually Lonnie and JTA if necessary). But for the longer term vision and avoiding the ""rinse &amp; repeat"" we've done over the last few summers, it would be more beneficial to trade Russel's huge salary and get back players that we could keep long term.

So, assuming Gary Trent is open to re-signing with the lakers this summer (we already know Turner is VERY open), here's a trade I'd really really love to see : 

Westbrook + picks for Myles + Gary Trent. Spurs get included to take-on Westbrook's salary for a second rounder, and Lakers get back 2 wings (% wise, would be by far our best shooting wings on the roster). Spurs also get to dump the last year of Doug's contract. If necessary, I'd absolutely throw-in a second rounder to the raptors to make it happen.

Given Carlisle doesn't want to trade Myles, giving them TB might sweeten the deal (+ the big trade exception they generate). We won't be able to resign TB this summer anyway.
Since they don't take back any contract + get a first for an expiring contract (who doesn't want to resign), it's only fair that they are the ones to pay the spurs for facilitating the trade.

Salary-wise, we could keep Walker and still execute the trade. But we know our front-office really really doesn't want to pay any luxury tax, so sending out Lonnie balances the outgoing and incoming salaries.

Rotations post-trade : 
PatBev - Trent Jr - LeBron - AD - Turner
Schroeder - Reaves - Josh - Doug - Wenyens 

In the off-season, you get to start with a nucleus of Trent - Bron - AD - Turner alongwith Reaves - Doug - Wenyens. That's very solid compared to the last couple of summers we've had.

Comparing that to Lebron who has for years invested heavily into recovery, sleep science, hyperbaric chambers, whatever the cutting edge of training was he seemed to be on it...it got me thinking that could Kobe have been even greater than he was if he dialled back the mamba a bit and approached the game a little more holistically?

This is obviously better for the lakers if he continues to play all year, but does it matter with regards to his value as a tradeable asset?   


I would almost argue that unless he starts shooting a league average 3 pt percentage, he would not be able to help a team compete for a championship and the only teams willing to trade for him would be ones tanking and trying to shed long term salary.   


With that being the case, his trade value may have actually decreased as he is more likely to help a team that does not want to win, win a few more games.",1.0

Lebron James and Russell Westbrook have recently been putting in some work together and their chemistry has shown on the court. 

With an offensive rating of 130.1 and defensive rating of 87.9 the duo is leading the league in two player lineups for the overall best net rating of +42.1

Even more interesting is that Westbrook is listed three times in the top 25 two player lineups indicating that when he‚Äôs on the floor the lakers are playing well. (Russ + Wenyen, Russ + Schroeder)

Undoubtedly, Russ has made it easier for Lebron to score and Lebron has been the ultimate complimentary off ball player for Russ.

In their shared minutes, Russ has mostly been running the offense something that is very new even to this season, and once AD returns Russ will have two of the best off ball options to get the ball two taking the lakers offense to an even higher level

5149,2023-01-18 17:28:00,10fd50v,The reason why Beverley has been so much worse on offense this season compared to with Minnesota is because his AST has been cut in half,Nathan185,"This is going to be a tough post for some people to be open-minded to, and I understand, because Patrick Beverley has been a disappointment for the most part this season.

Pat Bev was rightly hyped up as someone who was going to impact the Lakers and ‚Äúdo the little things‚Äù before the season, and for good reason: Patrick Beverley‚Äôs advanced stats in his season with Minnesota were INCREDIBLY good. Most impact metrics had him as one of the most impactful role players in the league. Most impact metrics had him as around a +3.0 per 100 possessions on the floor, which is incredible for a player that averages less than 10 PPG.

The main reason for this is that PatBev averaged 4.6 assists per game last year for the Timberwolves, on only 1.3 TOV. That is incredibly efficient playmaking, bordering on Chris Paul levels of taking care of the ball. Patrick Beverley‚Äôs strongest trait is that he is a very efficient secondary playmaker.

Now that he‚Äôs playing with a team with Russ (and to a lesser extent LeBron), literally all they let him do is catch and shoot 3‚Äôs, and rather than using his high AST/TOV playmaking, they insist on running the offense through Russ, who has a poor AST/TOV ratio.

What this team needs badly is shooters, not playmakers. PatBev is an extraordinary secondary playmaker, which is why he‚Äôs been a viable player in the league for so long, but he never gets to playmake because Russ has the ball the entire time LeBron is on the bench.",1.0

4. If we don‚Äôt play defence anyways we might as well give swider some pt to see if he can hit some shots, at least try something different. 

5. Similar to 4, there are no adjustments. I admit, I was a ham supporter and a Vogel critic but I came to realization that ham isn‚Äôt  ready to be a head coach.

With that being said, we‚Äôve all noticed the glaring issue in our late game offense is how stagnant it gets.  The ball stops moving, and we routinely go to the same play: Lebron iso on the perimeter, he holds the ball, and shoots a contested 3.  In years past this was a decent look and guarantees that your best player takes the critical shots.

[However this year Lebron is shooting](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/shots-closest-defender?CloseDefDistRange=2-4+Feet+-+Tight&amp;PerMode=Totals)‚Ä¶

- 29.3% from 3

- 11.1% from 3 on contested shots (nearest defender is 2-4 feet) on 27 attempts 

For reference Westbrook is shooting‚Ä¶

- 29.3% from 3

- 18.2% from 3 on contested shots on 11 attempts

I completely understand that our lack of shooting is killing our spacing *but* we can‚Äôt rely on an 11% 3-pointer during late game situations.  Also I‚Äôm not at all saying Westbrook should be taking those shots either.  Surely our coaching staff can figure out higher percentage offensive schemes for late game.

TLDR: Lebron is shooting 11% from 3 this season on contested 3-pointers which is a signature of our late game offense",1.0

I think the next step for him is to get better on defense. When you look at his body type and structure it reminds me of Clint Capella in a sense. Capella has been an elite rim protector for a the past few yrs dating back to his time in Houston. Bryant is 6""10 with a 7'6 wingspan so you'd think he'd have potential to be an elite two way big who can be great on offense as well as swat shots out the building with his long arms. But for some reason his moter on defense isn't what it should be it looks like he's slow on that end and is easy able to cross up if switched. When he faced elite bigs he gets cooked. Personally, I think it shouldn't be right to judge him completely until he gets with AD in the starting line up and gets to show his full potential as a BIG. Given how quick of a decision maker he is on the offensive side I think he can be a great supporter for him even if he not the best on D he can be a good help defender given AD is a beast on defense. He tries hard as hell its just that his mechanics to me aren't where they need to be. Maybe it will improve throughout the season. 

IMO a prime Thomas Bryant is a better Clint Capella with more of an actual offensive skill set coupled with elite shot blocking ability.",1.0

The biggest issue with him is he can't close because of how erratic he is and he fucks up our spacing around LeBron and AD. If we can bring in two good starters who can shoot and keep him on the bench in closing situations then it would be fine to keep him, arguably better compared to alternatives. Ham just needs to make sure he staggers him with only one of LeBron/AD and never play him with both.

Someone suggested doing

Pat Bev + Thomas Bryant + FRP for Myles Turner

and

Lonnie + Nunn + Damian Jones + FRP for Gary Trent Jr.

Ive said it before, Russel Westbrook is still a great passer and he pushes the tempo really well where the Lakers succeed. If we trading Russ, we need another passer making Bron a scorer. Rumors has it that DLo is on the trading block. Trading for him will fill the PG duties while also adding shooting to the team. Also this is his last year, resigning him for 20-25 mil  would be a steal while having money to extend contracts of TB and Reeves. Dream scenario would be adding DLo and Bogdanovic to this team.

Meaning players we can get better for value by trading them for someone else? There are six players that have been mentioned most in potential trades and here‚Äôs how I feel about them:

Damian Jones: This one goes without saying. I‚Äôm sure even he wants to get traded at this point. The man has banana peels for hands and doesn‚Äôt offer much else.

JTA: He‚Äôs not particularly bad and he‚Äôs not particularly good. He‚Äôs a minimum player and his skillset reflects as much. While I love his hustle I won‚Äôt mind losing him in a deal to bring back a better wing. Won‚Äôt mind him staying either.

Kendrick Nunn: Starting to find his groove but we have a log jam of guards on the team who do everything he does but better. One of the bigger salaries amongst role players too. A change of scenery is best for both parties.

Lonnie Walker: This is a little controversial because he‚Äôs been so good especially at the start of the season. But he‚Äôs regressed and his skillset is redundant with Schroeder and Reaves. His salary also makes him a good trading chip. I am intrigued by the prospect of a Lonnie/Schroeder backcourt though.

Pat Bev: He is an easy target because of his contract and how badly he started the season but he‚Äôs gotten his shot back, plays good defense and has intangibles like we saw yesterday that can amount to winning especially in a playoff environment. I don‚Äôt know how I feel about trading him.

Russ: The elephant in the room. I‚Äôm going to be honest, I never wanted him here. I thought he was a bad fit on the team since the trade was announced and unfortunately I, like many others was proven right about my trepidations about him. Trading him is also what‚Äôs best to get more out of our cap situation. But let‚Äôs be realistic here, is there really a trade for him that makes us exponentially better? You can talk about the Myles + Buddy trade but with how the Pacers have been competing I doubt that deal is still on the table. Trading for them also means we have virtually nothing left to re-sign our best playing role players this year, assuming we extend Myles.

Untouchables: Bron AD Reaves Christie.

Too hard to trade: Schroeder, Bryant, Wenyen, TBJ.

Tough decisions for our front office to make. Personally, I don‚Äôt think a massive trade is required for us to compete in this current NBA. The best-case scenario is to get a wing who can shoot or a wing with a reliable 3-pointer and a sharpshooter. Heck, maybe just get both Cam Reddish and Rui Hachimura or one of those two and a sharpshooter like Doug McDermott. The first four guys I mentioned plus a second-round pick or two can get that done. I like a lineup of Dennis, TBJ/LWIV/Bev (If one of them stays), LBJ, AD, and Bryant. Depending on the matchup, you can switch either TBJ or Bryant with whichever wing we get or a sharpshooter and move AD to the 5. 

Indeed, most of our success is going to be predicated on AD and LeBron‚Äôs health. With how those two have been playing and the parity in the league, anything is possible with a tweak or two. Do you guys have any realistic ideas for beneficial trades that aren‚Äôt just for the sake of making a trade like a lot of the awful ones floating on this sub?",1.0

He‚Äôs a good player, don‚Äôt get me wrong. Good defender and a solid shooter. However, he‚Äôs in the last year of his contract so trading picks for him to leave the next year wouldn‚Äôt exactly be great. 

Disregarding that and looking simply at what he provides for this team, I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs a *great* fit. A lot of our problems rn would be solved with AD coming back. As well as this, with TB playing so well, it wouldn‚Äôt make sense to add a *third* center. It would make either TB or Turner quite redundant at times. When it‚Äôs time to close games, we all know AD will be at the 5 and I‚Äôd therefore prefer we trade for a closer. 

With that being said, I don‚Äôt *hate* the idea, but I simply don‚Äôt understand the obsession with this guy. As well as this, he comes with Hield who has a terrible contract for multiple years. Though he is a good shooter, he‚Äôs terrible on defense (to say the least) and also isn‚Äôt closing games. Seriously, help me understand the obsession with this guy",1.0

5413,2023-01-24 02:51:35,10jv9d5,Updated practical max cap-space chart for next season after Rui Hachimura trade,BrianC_,"After the Rui Hachimura trade went down, I saw some incorrect numbers thrown around regarding the Laker's cap-space for next season and I figured I would just post an updated chart.

Player Name | Cap amount
:-- | :-- 
LeBron James | $46.9m
Anthony Davis | $40.6m
Rui Hachimura | $18.8m (cap-hold), $8.5m qualifying offer
Austin Reaves | $2.1m (cap-hold)
Wenyen Gabriel | $1.9m (cap-hold)
Max Christie | $1.7m
FRP cap-hold | ~$2.3m
Incomplete roster cap-hold | $1.1m
Incomplete roster cap-hold | $1.1m
Incomplete roster cap-hold | $1.1m
Incomplete roster cap-hold | $1.1m
Incomplete roster cap-hold | $1.1m
*Total payroll* | *$119.8m*
*Projected cap* | *$134m*
*Remaining cap-space* | *$14.2m*

This is not the team's max cap-space.  In theory, they could still waive all their cap-holds and push it up to around ~$36m.  But, that's obviously not very practical.

For this chart, the team would keep the cap-holds for Reaves and Wenyen to retain their early-bird-rights and would keep the cap-hold for Hachimura to retain his full-bird-rights.  They would keep their 2023 FRP and thus still have its cap-hold on the books (projected 20ish pick).  LeBron, AD, and Christie are still under contract for next season.  Damian Jones would be dumped in a deal if he opts into his player-option.  Everyone else would be left to expire.

I personally don't think Rui Hachimura will get an annual salary of $18.8m so his cap-hold really has no inherent value and the team would be better off negotiating an extension at a lesser value before the off-season.  If they can reach an agreement on an extension less than $18.8m, the Lakers would have more cap-space than projected above in the chart by however much less his extension is (for example, if Hachimura agrees to $13m annually, the Lakers would have an additional $5.8m in cap-space).",1.0

Defensive Box Plus/Minus wise, he's a **0.4 rating** which he sits #62 in the top 100 players **league-wide** and other solid defenders with the same *DBPM* rating? It's reassuring:

* Jayson Tatum
* Marcus Smart

Should it?,chasinjason13,"In all the great discussions about the trade deadline and what the Lakers should/might do, I haven‚Äôt heard anyone in this sub talk about the impact of future cap spikes on some of these deals.

Quick Example: Guys like GTJ, Rui, etc., guys who will need to be resigned next year if we trade for them is actually a GOOD thing. 

If we traded for a guy like GTJ and he wants to re-sign at $20mil a year, we need to remember that the cap s expected to be $10mil more next year and almost $40mil HIGHER in 2024. 

Right now $20mil is 16% of the salary cap but in two years it will only be 12% and will, depending on the player, look like an absolute steal. 

I started thinking about this this off-season when people were talking about RJ Barrett maybe being in a trade for someone somewhere. Instead, the Knicks re-signed him and although that number is high right now, if he turns into an all start it won‚Äôt just be a decent deal, it will be a great one.

This is also one of the things that keeps bringing me back to Zach Lavine. He‚Äôs as big a long-term risk as AD in terms of throwing away future seasons because of injury but if he‚Äôs healthy he will be an absolute STEAL at that salary in a few years.

So what do you all think and does this/is this changing your trade opinions at all? Or adding to it?

But Bron would‚Äôve been an all-time great literally anywhere you put him.  

1 - #1 all time at point guard. He‚Äôd be better than Magic, and it wouldn‚Äôt even be that close.  

2 - #3 all time at shooting guard. Michael and Kobe were both better pure scorers than Bron.

3 - #1 all time at the 3. This is more or less his position when he‚Äôs not playing center because the entire lineup besides him is 6‚Äô tall.  

4 - #4 all time. This is a tough one. Tim Duncan is definitely better than Bron would‚Äôve been as a dedicated 4. Garnett too. Bron would‚Äôve been better than either Malone or Barkley. And Giannis is obviously better than Bron now, but peak Bron? And where does Dirk fit in to all of this. 

5 - Kareem, Russel, Wilt, Shaq, and Hakeem all definitely better. Ditto for David Robinson. I think he‚Äôd have been better than Moses Malone and definitely Ewing. Not sure about Dwight and Zo (nba top 75 order be damned). And he wouldn‚Äôt be better than Jokic or Embiid. #9 all time at center.  

There‚Äôs that old story about the Trailblazers who drafted Sam Bowie ahead of Jordan. A scout was begging them to draft Jordan, but the Blazers were like, ‚ÄúWe need a center.‚Äù Scout goes, ‚ÄúPlay him at center.‚Äù But if it had been Lebron I‚Äôm convinced they could have actually played him at center and he would‚Äôve been top 10 all time at the position.",1.0

Trade 2027 unprotected pick protected for Gary and Fred, Max would have to go to sweeten the deal.

Trade 2029 protected for Bojan 

The Lakers won the title with shooters like KCP/ Green/ Morris/ Kuzma even Rondo was knocking threes

We already know Gary and Bojan are good at that already and Fred is a streaky shooter too that controls the pace and has won a championship before. 2023 and 2024 there are no star free agents, It is in 2025 that players like Tatum, Ingram will be free agents, you can sign players next year to two-year contracts and Fred and Gary could be signed for that. I would do this trade because you can have a line up of AD, JAMES, BOJAN, TRENT, FRED to close out games and you have shooters everywhere for Lebron and AD to operate in the clutch. Being that the Raptors are not contending and can lose them for nothing I would take a hard look at themselves because they wont be able to sign OG if they keep Fred and Gary.

Let‚Äôs be honest, even with let‚Äôs say you get Hield and Turner. How is that an assurance that they can get a title? If AD comes back and is healthy then maybe? But even then, do they see them spending the rest of their remaining years with the Lakers or just leave after a year or two? Plus Lebron has 2-3 years left probably. Is burning those 2 picks really worth it? Like remember when we literally cant draft people because we don‚Äôt have picks? We only became relevant again when Lebron signed. I dont see AD being a centerpiece when Lebron retires. Like I don‚Äôt see him carrying the Lakers. Westbrook is there because the FO scorched the entire roster and traded all our pieces (that was #1 defense that year) for someone they literally targeted on defense during their last championship run and let‚Äôs be honest because Lebron wanted him. 

Correcting a mistake with a big gamble isn‚Äôt good business. To me either trade Russ and probably some players to contend or keep Russ and hope they figure it out and be healthy. But don‚Äôt touch those picks. 

IF they touch those picks may it be towards a talent that actually can be a centerpiece for a long time and not just leave when things are bad.",1.0

Bryant, plus he's going to come at half the cost this off-season (if we bring him back). Also worried Turner would/could leave us for nothing

WB and Lonnie (maybe a protected 1st) for Buddy and McConnell

Buddy helps tremendously on the perimeter plus occasionally he can create for himself and others. Would be better than Lonnie.

McConnell doesn't completely replace WB assists but it's not bad. Plus there won't be as many wild turnovers.

Gives us a trade exception too if I'm not mistaken. Could be worth 20+ mil. 

After watching yesterday's game all it took was those three 3s in a row and it made a huge difference for us.

Indiana's motivation could be us clearing up 27 mil for them this offseason and picking up Lonnie. (Possibly throw in a pick swap or a protected pick)",1.0

5555,2023-01-26 22:24:19,10m4f2z,Who is out of rotation?,Bigpoppalos,"Hey guys, I am super excited for the rest of the season, we have been playing well without ad, lonnie and reaves, now all of a sudden we get them back plus rui. Question now is, who is out of rotations because IMO we are a deep team and someone is going to be upset. This is not about who starts, who finishes or actual rotations, just who isnt going to play. 

Roster, not including jones, cole and pippen and in no particular order:

Guards: bev, max, reaves, schoder, loni, west

Wings: troy, rui, bron, jta

Bigs: TB, AD, wenyen

Thats 13 deep, right off the bat we see that wenyen and JTA will not play, leaves us 11. I see it better to have a 9 man rotation leaving 2 more players out.

Easiest part are the bigs AD and Tb will play. Tb defense isnt great but hes been scoring, shooting 3 and bringing energy for us. Occasionally rui will play small ball here as well.

The wings of course lebron, brown has been shooting well and playing good defense so him and the aforementioned rui. Max and reaves can also play here.

Guards is where it gets tough. Someone one will get pissed. I go defense first ( I see it as who can defend the warriors, curry and klay) so has to be bev and shroder. Then reaves and max because they can also play wings and are young. Max has been impressive, hes good defensively and can shoot the 3, because of him the ones left out will be mad. 

So is it westbrook and lonnie that should sit? (Max because hes a rookie or maybe TB because hes a big?) Thats my conclusion but its tough because both bring a lot offensively. Specially westbrook, he gets a lot of easy buckets for our bigs and bron, and of course lonnie was our big signing and most athletic but I just dont see Max get benched at this point right? IMO westbrook has been playing great but I just dont like him in the final minutes of games or defensively. Its going to be interesting to watch what Ham does. Thoughts?",1.0

Since around 2020 or 2021 LeBron has been very outspoken and the loudest voice in the league about how he feels negatively when it comes to the police due to some brutality happening around America. Some people may know this but cops or former cops have a real hobby of reffing basketball games in their spare time 

A lot of these NBA refs are older men who lean right wing ([Former NBA refs claim they were fired for COVID vax refusal, allege 'jab or job ultimatum'])(https://www.foxnews.com/sports/former-nba-refs-claim-they-were-fired-covid-vax-refusal-allege-jab-job-ultimatum.amp) so LeBron being outspoken negatively about the police/left wing ideals is basically a big fuck you too these guys, they take it as disrespect and you know how much the right wing hates LeBron

Not trying to start some political war here I just I feel this has affected LeBron/The Lakers whistle a lot.

lakers getting the 4th pick with rumors of AD interested in joining them and the pelicans wanting picks to trade him was *very* predictable.

  Lose CP3, draft AD. Lose AD, draft Zion. 

 

Ewing wing frozen/folded envelope. That year the audit company that's forever audited the draft, their parent company had something like 80% ownership in MSG.

2010 - Wizards owner had just died, and the league wanted to get past the Arenas gun drama ASAP. Wizards move up from 4th to 1st to draft John Wall.

2012 - Pelicans had just been bought and relocated to New Orleans, so the league rigged it to give them an instant superstar in AD to jumpstart the team and create a solid fanbase in New Orleans.

2010 through 2014 - LeBron left for Miami and the Cavs then get the #1 pick three out of four years because the league felt bad for the Cavs and didn't want them to fall into utter mediocrity, OR they knew LeBron would one day return and wanted them to have tons of trade bait.

\- Averaging 188pg and 45% from three on 9 attempts a game (only Tatum, Simons, Klay, Lillard shoot more 3s a game)

\- Offensive raptor of +2.0 and defensive raptor of -0.7

\- Russell westbrook has a defensive raptor of -2.6. Lonnie has a defensive raptor of -1.8 (and an even worse offensive raptor of -2.6 for some reason). 

\- His defense isn't anything to die for but he has multiple games of 2 or more steals and even had a game with 4 steals and 3 blocks a few days ago.   


**Myles Turner in 2023**

\- He's an elite floor stretching center that is also a rim protector, a rare specimen: ""Turner is one of three players with at least 50 3-pointers and 75 blocks this season -- along with Memphis' Jaren Jackson Jr. and Milwaukee's Brook Lopez""

\- He is averaging 18 ppg and 39% from three on 4 attempts a game 

\- Most importantly he's averaging 2.4 blocks a game

&amp;#x200B;

**What we Can do Moving Forward**

\- It is clear we need a shooter, a big man, and utilize westbrook to get some solid role players back (we will have to attach picks of course)

\- A three team deal with the raptors which gets us Poetl and GTJ 

\- A deal with Hornets that gets us Rozier/Plumlee and a filler (not as desirable but I like Plumlee this season)

\- A deal with Orlando which gets us Gary Harris/Mo Bamba. Bamba is shooting 39% from three on around 3 attempts a game and 1 block per game. Gary Harris is less of a true shooter, and I'm not too excited about him although he's shooting a career high % from three this year.

When the NBA partnered with gambling apps for a share of their revenue, they should have outsourced their reffing to an organization not tied to gambling.

Since the NBA makes more money when gamblers lose more money. This sets up a situation where the league has the incentive to fix games. The Lakers have the largest fan base. Someone posted that 90 percent of the money line bets were on the Lakers last night. This was one of the premier games in the league and I expect there was heavy action. It literally meant that the league made millions of dollars in extra revenue when the ref ""missed' the call on Lebron last night.

The no call occurred on a 2 point play. LeBron should have been at the line shooting 2 free throws to potentially win the game. There's no debating that.

However, think back on all the mistakes the Lakers made throughout the game which cost them multiple 2 point opportunities. The turnovers, the bad possessions, the poor shot selection, the lack of effort, even the bad clock management in OT.

We have seen a pattern throughout this season with this team not being able to finish close games against great teams. They often fail to execute in crucial moments. We all know this, we've all seen it. Complaining about a no call at the end of the game is a red herring. It's a way for the Lakers, even LeBron, to let themselves off the hook for their lack of execution.

Any great player or coach would tell you that if you're living or dying by a single call or no call by the refs, then you HAVEN'T WON THE GAME. You haven't done enough. This can happen at any time, regular season or playoffs. Great teams, great players, DO NOT RELY on foul calls to win games. They assume that they will NOT get any calls, and then ensure that they execute solidly enough to win the game anyway.

Hell, the Lakers STILL had a chance to win the game. They had another OT period in which they were, once again, not able to execute. Worthy and others said the team seemed to have the wind knocked out of it after the no call. Why? What's more important to you, winning the game, or whining about the no call? You're gonna spite yourself out of a win just because you're pissed at the refs or the league?

That's not championship basketball. That's not mental toughness. That's not how any of the greats would approach the game. You play to win. You execute. If you still have a chance to win, even under the most harrowing of circumstances, you don't let up until the clock says zero.

The Lakers should be more upset about their inability to execute down the stretch in close games than they ever are about a call. If they're not, then they're not tough enough to live up to their potential.",1.0

I know this seems dramatic as all teams deal with shitty calls, but it feels especially bad for the lakers this season. And again it‚Äôs not just because of last nights game against the Celtics, but that felt like the straw that broke the camels back. There‚Äôs been at least 3-4 games that resulted in a loss due to the refs and when the standings are so tight and a 38 yr old lebron is killing himself out there to get us wins it‚Äôs just so disheartening to see. 

Lakers are clearly a much better team than their record shows and we‚Äôve competed with the best teams in the league but it truly feels rigged at this point.

So I ask you, what are you doing to deal with this feeling? I‚Äôd recommend everyone with league pass cancel that shit. But what else?

Sorry I just needed to vent. I know this seems overly dramatic and every team feels screwed over by the refs from time to time but enough is enough",1.0

However, Ham does have control in putting us in positions to win the game. At the very least, we should be playing optimally rather than hurting ourselves given our seeding.

A list of things Ham can fix right now:

1. No 3 guard lineups - Easiest fix he can make without disrupting anything. There is no reason Bev, Dennis, and Russ should be on the floor together given our personnel.

2. Bring Max/Wenyen back - Our best effort players should absolutely not be out of the rotation. These guys bring length, athleticism, rebounding, defending, and hustle no matter what.

3. Frontload Russ minutes - We know Ham will never bench this guy for extended periods. But Russ actively hurts the team on both sides of the floor when he‚Äôs out there. Play Russ 20-25 minutes without any minutes in the 4th. Ham has done this a few times but needs to be more consistent.

4. Play the hot hand - If Lonnie or TB are cooking, play them more. We have role players that won‚Äôt be consistent night in and night out. It should be intuitive to Ham to keep playing the ones that are in the groove. 

What other quick fixes would you make?",1.0

I'm gonna talk about this season because we can agree last season he was bad. 


Having a good 5-10 game stretch doesnt justify having another 5-10 bad games afterwards. He's had more really bad games than good and thats not good enough for our supposed 3rd scoring option. People keep saying that we'll miss his playmaking but I dont think that's entirely true. I think dennis and austin reeves can carry that load but maybe a bit worse. Either way russ's playing making on this team is canceled out by his bad shooting percentage and timely turnovers. 


Russ this season is averaging 15.8/6.3/7.5 and 3.6 TOV on 41.6%. FG, 28.9% 3PT, 66.4% FT which comes out to 49.5% TS. That's like 6% off league avg for PGs. 

People are also saying that we need to include a 1st round pick to just get rid of him and thats why a trade isnt being made but what I think is holding back a trade is the lakers looking for that big eye catching trade for him. This doesnt need to be the case. Russ is on an expiring deal and there is only 30 games left in the season. By now alot of teams have figured out if they tanking or contending so it would be easier for them to make trades and clear salaries. The FO wants to trade for a player like myles turner or GTJ which would cost at least a 1st roumd pick. I'm all for these trades to make the team better but if the FO doesnt think so, at least trade russ to get salaries to work with next offseason (which might cost a 2nd). Not trading russ and having him expire with no chance of resigning him, we'll be at a situation we had last offseason where we are basically signing vet minimums. Its also better for russ to be traded so that he can get his numbers up and get a good contract in the offseason cause his numbers right now wont net him as much as he thinks he deserves.

Also i'm tired of people keep complaining about him every single game even if its his fault. I'm more concerned with our wonderful coach and his 6 ft lineups he keep putting out and his terrible missed timeouts he doesnt call.",1.0

But yesterday he seemed a bit more laid back than usual. He was looking to pass way more often and only had 24 points by the end of regulation. If he intends to play our next four games, he'll break the record against OKC with his current averages. But if averages about 25 points, he will break the record in a Laker jersey,  at home and against Kareems other team. I fully expect him to take on this facilitator role for the next few games leading up to him breaking the record and hopefully we don't need him to exert himself scoring to win which I'm sure is the most important thing to him.

We get expiring GT and 1.5 years of FVV. I think it gets us a shooting wing and FVV handles scoring load with most of his mins on 2nd unit, a few with starters if he gels (Denny to 2nd unit)

5977,2023-02-02 13:47:22,10rq7r4,Does anybody else believe we can beat any team in west (except denver) in a 7 game series,utrid_son_of_utrif,"IF we make the playoffs and are fully healthy, i think we can compete with any of the teams with the experience we have except maybe denver. We have been playing and beating the best teams out there and I dont see how we couldnt figure it out in a 7 game series (granted we have to make it there first).

Lets look at the teams in contention. We'll probably be at the bottom half of the playoffs and play a top 4 seed in the west. Ill say denver beats us (although we beat them 2-1 in h2h). Memphis dont seem consistent as last year and their core are still young and inexperienced so ill probably favor the lakers in 7.  

The kings are the 3rd seed and as well as they are playing, can we really not beat them? Sabonis isnt a great rim protector and we get most of our shots from inside the paint. Fox is a future superstar but not there yet. The clippers are 4th right now and honestly im not sure how they are 4th. They've been good lately but kawhi and PG dont sound scary as they used to. PG's taking a back seat to kawhi and kawhi's been slowly getting there and im not sure if he'll be 100% in the playoffs. 

I wont talk about the rest because they're all jammed together but the only team that could give us problems is GSW although their lack of bigs could be good for us. Also, dallas is a one man show and as much as love luka and he'd probably drop 50 on us, I cant see him winning the series on his own against us.",1.0

5989,2023-02-02 19:13:54,10ry2df,Flea's open letter to struggling Laker Kwame Brown,ocmaddog," dear kwame,  
 please forgive this fanatical letter  
 but i am a laker fanatic  
 it's an insanity i allow myself  
 

i am writing you this open letter as a fan and a fellow human being.  
 i know that you are a man of reasonable intelligence  
 and a man of considerable emotional depth  
 so i write this letter, leaving none of my thoughts dormant  
 hoping that i can be of some inspiration to you  
 

being a devoutly loyal laker fan  
 i watch nearly every laker game all season long  
 and have done so for several years  
 when i heard word of you coming to the lakers in exchange for caron  
 butler and chucky atkins  
 i was excited and pleased  
 i was gonna miss caron, but understood that the lakers had a stockload  
 of players at his position, his size  
 and needed to correct that imbalance  
 i really saw this move as a great opportunity for you to get a fresh  
 start and show what you were really capable of  
 and bring the lakers up  
 

it must have been weird going from high school straight to the  
 wizards and being yelled at by michael jordan   
 after all, you were just a youngster and learning the professional game  
 and it must have been a whirlwind of strangeness, just making that  
 transition from being a boy to being a man, and having to deal with all  
 that pressure, and having it play out in the public eye  
 i can only try to imagine what it was like  
 god knows it probably would have driven me crazy  
 i would probably have said and done crazy things  
 or even withdrawn and shut down and stopped myself from growing the way  
 i was capable of  
 so anyways, i thought that it would be great for you to get away from  
 d.c. and get a fresh start  
 especially with phil jackson around, whom i perceive as a thoughtful  
 and kind man  
 i compared your situation to jermaine oneal's, who didn't do so great  
 in portland  
 and was there for 4 years just like you in d.c. but then got a fresh  
 start with the pacers and really blossomed  
 

so here we are nearly half way through your first season in los angeles  
 my hometown, on my beloved lakers  
 and you still are not playing close to the way you are capable of  
 playing  
 there are those people in l.a. and around the country who just   
 don't think you are capable of playing at a higher level   
 that this is all you've got  
 and if there are a percentage of people who think that  
 i bet you even think it sometime  
 or even worse, maybe you have fallen into a rut  
 maybe it is depressing to have bad games and you have given up on  
 reaching for that highest part of yourself  
 that part that you get in touch with sometimes when you show flashes of  
 the greatness within you  
 

those people who think that you are not better than you are playing now  
 are wrong  
 if you think it you are wrong  
 you are as great as you want to be  
 you could be one of the great power forwards to play in the nba  
 you can turn it around  
 you are young there is plenty of time  
 you only live this life once  
 and you cannot leave the greatness within you unexpressed  
 it would be a disservice to the universe  
 unless of course you know in your heart that you would rather be doing  
 something else and you are only in the nba for the cash   
 in which case you should go do that other thing  
 because you do only get to live this life once  
 and it is a crying shame when people leave their song unsung  
 but to the pedestrian fan like myself  
 it sure seems like you were born to tear it up on the hoop   
 court  
 

i know that for myself  
 there have been many times in my life when i was so down  
 anxiety ridden and confused  
 that i was not nearly as great at being who i am  
 or feeling the joy and love and opportunity of each day  
 not even reaching in the right direction to get on the righteous path  
 not even capable of trying  
 because i was lost  
 barking up the wrong tree  
 hurting inside  
 

it took me a while to get to it  
 but i found ways to get back to feeling great and doing my best  
 i developed a spiritual practice  
 i went to a therapist and worked on emotional issues  
 that had been messing with me all my life  
 sometimes i would feel so lousy  
 i didn't even know what was bothering me  
 i tried hard to figure it out  
 and i got help from god and from smart people  
 and i let go of years of stuff that was slowing me down  
 i'm far from perfect but i am a lot better and still working on it  
 i am a happy man  
 

now i ask you please not to take offense at this kwame  
 i do not pass judgement  
 but it seems to me that something is troubling you  
 and keeping you from your own greatness  
 and you need to work it out  
 

i see you not try sometimes  
 i see you not go for the rebound sometimes  
 i see you not get back on defense sometimes  
 i see you not help out on defense sometimes  
 

and once in a while i see you block a shot get an awesome rebound and  
 explode to the hoop like a genius and put the ball in the hole with  
 great gusto  
 

i know that you could be great all the time  
 do what it takes to make your mind clear and your heart free  
 therapy  
 meditation  
 whatever you can do to help yourself  
 so you can give your all  
 do it  
 start now  
 

i know you want the respect that comes with being great at what you do  
 

kwame brown could be a hero in this town  
 the x factor that brings the lakers a championship  
 

dont leave your sung unsung

Nets odds doubled I think from 7/1 to 14/1 ( can‚Äôt remember exact ). At the time it was an expected 50-60% odds move .

Our odds a week ago were 50/1, they went to 35/1 after these last two wins/Celtics competitive loss. They moved now in last day from 35/1 to 22:1, the last 5/1  bit JUST FROM KYRIE RUMOUR I believe . This isn‚Äôt as big a move as in the summer with kyrie but it‚Äôs still a real move reflecting it not alll being copium . This gives us some odds 

I‚Äôd advise people to not expect it as the lines woukd move more if it was closer to being a thing, but it‚Äôs out there as a thing at least. If we get closer I‚Äôd expect further odds moving. Don‚Äôt expect kyrie , but I seriously don‚Äôt think his trade value is very high ti any other team , dunno why others woukd risk it on him like us ( cos we got Russ to move n Lebron here),  
likely the nets work out a way to stay , as long as Russ is moved eventually it‚Äôs ok for us.  Don‚Äôt get bummed if we don‚Äôt get kyrie , but let‚Äôs hope for the best . Oh also nets odds moved from 10/1 to 14/1 ( maybe was 7-9/1 last couple weeks ir even just before this rumour )",1.0

As a long time Laker fan, and youth basketball coach, I find it absurd that people shat on Vogel as a coach, and somehow think Ham is just as good or better. This roster and player availability is MILES better than last year.  AD only played 40 games last year, and LBJ 56. This year AD has already played 29, and LBJ 42. 

I don't want to beat a dead horse, but Ham is a really bad HC. Not just bad. Really bad. Why?

1) He tried to institute a 4 in 1 out offense on a team that doesn't have outside shooting. Never made sense from the start.

2) He is horrible at half-time and in game adjustments. He has slightly improved in this area lately, but he's been extremely bad over the course of the year. You can look to any game where the Lakers were +/- 5 points at the half and what their record is, and compare it to any decent HC. 

3) He has a horrible sense of timeout use and momentum swings. This is one area I expected him to at least be decent at, but it's been remarkably bad. This is one area I THINK he can improve in. 

4) Do I need to even mention the 3/4 guard lineups, let alone the dreaded 5 guard lineup. Sigh.

5) Allowing WB to close close games. I mean just look at the data and make an objective HCing decision here. 

&amp;#x200B;

As a Laker fan, I'm rooting for his success, but I'm just tired of reading this nonsense about Vogel. No coach is perfect. I guarantee none of you could have done a better job. But we lost a legit championship coach that could have guided this time to more championships w/ his defensive mindset. Players played together and played hard under him when he had a reasonable roster. 

**Good news:**

Lakers have one of the softest SOS's going forward. They have nearly everyone healthy, so they should go on a run. They have a good enough roster to win the West (not place first, but make it to the finals). That's assuming AD and LBJ can stay healthy. 

So no apologies... if this roster stays healthy, it's good enough to win. I guarantee you Vogel could win the west with this roster. Let's hope Ham figures some things out and gets these guys to gel.",1.0

He‚Äôs a top 3 iso scorer in the game and does it with so much efficiency and grace.

Him and LeBron are a proven fit. Kyrie has never ever closely played with someone like AD. I know we spam the Bron/AD pick and roll but could you imagine a Kyrie / AD pick and pop?

I honestly cannot believe folks are hesitant to include AR-15. He‚Äôs a fan favorite but his ceiling is a quality starter. If y‚Äôall think he‚Äôs a 3rd option or even 4th on a championship team y‚Äôall are delusional. 

The Nets have WAY more leverage than you think. Kyrie wants a max deal and that seems non negotiable. The dude already lost like 20m refusing to get the jab so don‚Äôt expect a discount. We cannot get him anywhere close to max money. The only teams with actual cap space to sign Kyrie outright are garbage non contending teams. 

The Nets sign and trade is the only way to acquire him and so if they decide they will play hardball they could fuck everything up.

If Reaves OR Max are being the held up Rob P and Jeanie are clueless. We don‚Äôt even play Max many games.

&gt;From owner Jeanie Buss on down ‚Äî president of basketball operations Rob Pelinka, James, Anthony Davis and the whole lot ‚Äî the Lakers power brokers universally believe that the 30-year-old disenfranchised point guard from the Brooklyn Nets is the kind of player who would greatly improve their chances of contending for a title this season.

&gt;According to a source with knowledge of the Lakers‚Äô discussions with Brooklyn, a significant obstacle emerged in the early stages of the talks between the Lakers and the Nets. The source, who was granted anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation, said the Lakers were only looking to give the Nets the kind of return they‚Äôre requesting if Irving was willing to accept the two-year, $78.6 million extension they could immediately agree on as part of the deal.

&gt;But Irving strongly prefers to play his current contract out with his hypothetical new team and sign a four-year, $198 million maximum salary deal that would be available to him this summer (because the team trading for him would also acquire his Bird rights). That revelation wasn‚Äôt a deal breaker, but it was an eyebrow-raiser. The Lakers, the source said, would offer significantly less in a deal if it‚Äôs clear Irving was only guaranteed to be a second-half rental.

Right now, the Lakers can only extend him to a 2 year deal. If they want to extend him 4 years, it can only be done in the offseason. This means a risk of Kyrie going back on his promise of extending, and could potentially end up only as a 6 months rental if he chooses to sign to another team in free agency.

The Lakers are still intrested in a deal even if he doesn't sign the 2 year extension right now, but they would offer significantly less in the deal, since there is a risk he ends up being only a rental player, a reminder of how Dwight Howard left in free agency after the Lakers just traded for him in the previous offseason. 

&gt;It‚Äôs clear the Lakers have serious competition for Irving‚Äôs services here, meaning they may have to make unwanted concessions if they‚Äôre going to get this deal done. But the Lakers want Irving. We know that much now. The question of whether they can land him remains to be seen.

**WB Team history:**

**2023** Desperately being traded 

**2022:** No play-in playing behind Lebron/AD

**2021:** First-round exit playing behind Beal

**2020:** Second-round exit (he missed a big portion of the 1st round and had shooting splits of roughly 42/26/54 in the second while averaging &gt;4 TO a game) playing behind Harden

**2019:** First-round exit playing behind PG

**2018:** First-round exit playing with PG and Melo 

**2017:** First-round exit

**Playing behind Durant** (A generational top 15 player)

**2016:** WCF, Russ's shooting splits were roughly 41/33/83 as the secondary option behind Durant.

**2015:** Missed the playoffs, Durant injured

**2014:** WCF, Russ's shooting splits were roughly 43/28/88 as the secondary option behind Durant. Russ missed 36 games, and the thunder went 25-11 without him in the regular season.

**2013:** Second round exit. He only played 2 games in the playoffs that year (both in round 1)

**2012:** Finals. Russ's shooting splits were roughly 44/29/80 as the secondary option behind Durant.

Certainly we could get a nice bounty of picks from a team willing to roll the dice on AD and maybe a young player or two, Lebron will be still in demand especially if either Miami or Cle think they could win it all with his reunion.

Conley is a steady hand PG that shoots the 3 ball and can play both on or off the ball 

Beasley is a professional shooter and would immensely open up the offense

Vando is a young lockdown defender

Second, the Lakers were not willing to include Austin Reaves and/or rookie Max Christie in the deal if Irving was not going to agree to the two-year contract extension, according to league sources. The Lakers view both players as key members of their young supporting cast, not merely throw-ins. They were only considering including one of them if they had assurances Irving wouldn‚Äôt just be a second-half rental.

I really like Conley‚Äôs fit next to Lebron and AD. Now yes, his contract IS bad. He IS older. He IS a 6‚Äô1‚Äù guard. These are all valid concerns. However, he‚Äôs about as sound and stable of a floor general as any team could ask for. Over the last four seasons he‚Äôs shot roughly 37-41% from three on 5-6 attempts. He plays well both on-ball AND off-ball. He‚Äôs genuinely still a sound and disciplined defender. He‚Äôs obviously not the defender he once was, but you could argue he‚Äôs between neutral to slightly positive on that end. He certainly makes up for Russ‚Äôs playmaking whilst also being a shooter with solid defense. He would be a $22 million expiring next year as well, which isn‚Äôt impossible to flip if necessary.

If we also do some other trade that sends out Beverley+Lonnie, our only small guards would be Schroeder and Conley, which is perfectly fine.

Beasley is a high-volume, movement shooter with a team option next season. Vanderbilt is a very good defender with size and a very good feel for rebounding. He‚Äôs only 23 too!

Especially if we also flip Beverley+Lonnie, I really like this Utah package (even more than the Toronto one since it would likely cost a lot more). That being said, I am going to keep my expectations super low and not expect anything. If, by some chance, we really do go for this move though, I would personally be very happy.

TLDR: Conley and the rest of the Utah package would actually go a long ways in rounding out this team.",1.0

6442,2023-02-07 16:53:23,10w6ox5,Wouldn't we rather have Clarkson instead of Conley? And Olynyk instead of Vanderbilt?,Zodraz,"We need a PG who can get their own shot -- that's not Conley, it's Clarkson.

And Vanderbilt has a lot of promise, but we need a veteran big man who knows how to play team defense and can shoot threes -- that's Olynyk.

So I think this is the best plausible Westbrook trade with Utah:

To Jazz | To Lakers | 2023-24 Contract Status
:-: | :-: | :-:  
Westbrook | Beasley | Team Option (16.5 M)
D. Jones | Olynyk | Team Option (12.2 M, 3 M guaranteed)
2029 first (unprotected) | Clarkson | Player Option (14.3 M)
 | U. Azubuike | Unrestricted Free Agent

The nice thing about this is we can still create a lot of cap space this summer:   

(a) Clarkson is almost certainly going to decline his option and become a free agent,   

(b) only 3 M of Olynyk's 2023-2024 salary is guaranteed (so it can be stretched to just a 1M cap hit over the next three years), and  

(c) Beasley's contract has no partial guarantee -- it's a full team option.

(d) The Jazz declined their fourth-year option on Azuibuke's rookie contract, so he's an UFA (I just included him so that we could get rid of Jones' contract for next year).  

So not only does this combination of players improve us the most this year, it also gives us the most free agent flexibility this summer...

LeBron

AD

Kuzma

KCP

Danny Green

Markieff Morris

Kuzma

Caruso

McGee

Dwight

Rondo

These were the players that brought us a ring in 2019-2020. 

Who on this years roster fills the roles provided by these players.

LeBron = Still LeBron just a couple of years older.

AD = Still AD. Maybe better when he is healthy.

Kuzma = Rui fills this role to an extent. Troy Brown Jr as well. 

KCP = ????

Danny Green = ?????

Markieff Morris = Rui fills this role to an extent.

Caruso = Reeves fills this role to an extent. Beverley fills this role to an extent

McGee = ?????

Dwight = Thomas Bryant fills this role to an extent.

Rondo = Dennis Schroder

He‚Äôs out of the magic rotation as the magic have too many young forwards to give their minutes to. He‚Äôs a young 6‚Äô8 3&amp;D type of player and I think he‚Äôs exactly what we‚Äôre looking for as he‚Äôs not ball dominant and can guard the opponents best wing and hit a 3 when we need him to. Now the only thing is he got injured in November and they said his timetable is a month. It‚Äôs February now and he still isn‚Äôt back so maybe the injury is more serious or the magic are taking it slow bringing him back since Isaac just returned as well so they‚Äôre in no rush for him. Anyway I think 1 or 2 second rounders might be enough to get him and he‚Äôd be a nice addition to the team and give us more height And shooting,1.0

I think the impending deadline has everyone in their head - even Bron and AD to a degree. Bron was out there playing for the scoring record but once he broke it he kinda went silent. AD had probably his worst game of the season so far.

The reason I say this is because this gave me loss in Portland against their g league team from last year, which was also right before the deadline. 

Again I have to imagine the tension permeated the locker room and had an impact on the energy and effort. It felt like there was a similar effect in New Orleans on Saturday.

6584,2023-02-08 10:00:30,10wsv3r,AD (and I just needed to vent),rick_32,"Look did AD have a good game? No... 

But... he got 31 weirdly disjointed minutes thanks to the geniuses on the coaching staff... thunder with 4-5 players in the paint almost every possession... 1st half he was rolling hard and our amazing 3 headed guard lineup was throwing some of the worst passes I've ever seen in traffic and often directly to the other team.  Ham subbed him out at 58 seconds left in the 3rd when Bron needed 1 bucket for the record and i'm pretty he was just bummed to not be on the court or maybe get the assist, etc... Look at his November and December game logs before he got hurt and even the last 3 games he played once he was off the minutes restriction... He has been balling. AD and Bron aren't the problem... sure it helps when they can stay healthy and AD has been hurt but they guy is fantastic and generally gives us his all on the court so I'm not going to crucify him for a tough night tonight under some very weird circumstances.  I get then sense he too is fed up with this coaching staff and maybe even russ after his comments tonight and the ones earlier in the year about the ""my bads""

The problem for the this team is the front office has fumbled every decision they've made since the start of the '20-'21 season... That offseason was actually pretty good, sure every move didnt work out perfect but the biggest problem on the title team was bench scoring when Bron/AD were resting so they tinkered and picked up the top 2 finishers in 6MOTY voting in Trez and DS and went for stretch big Gasol and lets face it they were criticized for letting brooke lopez go with ppl saying ""he'd have been perfect with LBJ &amp; AD"" so it made some sense and if you look at the stats, Gasol's minutes were a big positive esp knowing they planned to use AD at the 5 esp in crunch ch time. 

For me the beginning of the end was the trade deadline... they did all this shopping and alienated the roster (that made sense with the young bois tryna get AD or Kawhi but less with a team that was trying to win a title) before ultimately doing nothing, treating THT like the second coming of jordan and getting drummond in a buyout and stupidly promising he would start. All of that fucked with the locker room chemistry.

Now that team was beat from winning the title and the weird quick turn around to the season after the bubble but even with all that they were in good shape up 2-1 on the suns with AD dropping 34 in the 2 wins before he got hurt. So lost season... but we all knew it was going to be tough to turn around after that finals run and abbreviated offseason. But this was a good team that had some tough injuries but a few small movies might have made them contenders again in '21-'22... KCP, Caruso and Gasol all shot over 40% from three on over 9 combined attempts and Bron and Kuz each over 36% on a combines almost 12 attempts.  As a team they outshot their opponents from three percentage wise on the season .354 to .352.

Then here comes the nightmare... they WAYYY overreacted and thought hey let's trade all the pieces that are proven to fit with Bron &amp; AD plus a 1st round pick for russ... they guy we LITERALLY DIDN'T GUARD in the playoffs in 2020 and then surround them with the all geriatric/washed team... I mean Deandre Jordan was the starting center!? DJ Augustin, Isaiah Thomas, bring back Rondo who shot 36.6 percent... FROM 2!? I mean it says something when by the end of the season that rookie austin reeves and glorified g leaguer stanley johnson were 2 of the best role players on the team.  on top of that you let caruso go for nothing and kept THT when it would have cost 7 million to keep the goat ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. And intentionally or not russ basically sabotaged the season cuz he didnt like Vogel!? Stories of Rambis interfering in coaching decisions, etc... and then you fire the coach who had won you the title and replace him with an unproven rookie coach? and don't hire and experienced assistant!? 

And honestly most of the former player coaches I see that get the respect of their players were either high bbIQ stars (like J Kidd or larry bird) or at least starters (doc rivers) in the league or role players that contributed to great teams or championship teams (like brian shaw or ty lue)... ham was a straight up end of the bench guy who only once averaged more than 5 points in a season (5.1) I just dont think he is head coach material and the way his team is playing seems to prove that... They've given up 264 points in their last 2 games to teams that have been playing very poorly and when you watch them the players don't seem to have any idea what they are trying to accomplish on either end... tonight's loss was after a practice where they'd reportedly installed some things lol. The rotations are absolute trash, dont get me started on the 3 guards.  I mean just recently lebron was on the bench going into the 1/2... what was he resting for? Strenuous 1/2 time film session? And to not use their timeouts in the last couple possessions tonight is just so JV i don't even know what to say.  The thing to me that proves how poorly they are coached is they get behind and the game is essentially over and the players just press and play aggressive trapping defense which is outside of the normal defensive scheme and they make these almost comebacks basically everytime which just proves the normal scheme is shit.  Their three point defense is ""leave them other team wide open and hope they miss"".  On offense you can see other than AD and Bron there is no confidence or consistent aggressive play... players look like they are just hoping their shots go inü§ûüèæü§ûüèæ... there's no offense run to get guys to their preferred spots.  When Phil Jackson was coaching even guys like shannon brown, josh powell and dj mbenga would come in and play with confidence, know their roles and look completely familiar with the system.

Until today i really thought a trade could turn this team into a contender but with these inept coaches I just don't see any way that happens... i hope they prove me wrong and i HOPE TO GOD russ is gone by they end of the week.  Unless this team makes a run in the playoffs ham has GOT TO GO! (maybe even more than russ... but prolly not lol).

Anyway i just really needed to vent... After watching and loving this team for close to 40 years other than finals losses to boston and detroit this is the most upset ive been after a Lakers game.

The Los Angeles Lakers are a badly coached team. 

The defense is atrocious. Giving up 70+ points in the first half to Pelicans and Thunder is inexcusable. They both made 10+ threes in these halves. 

I blame coaching for this. Defensive schemes are just terrible if every team in the league shoots like prime Warriors against this team. 

It‚Äôs not a Russell Westbrook issue. Darwin Ham is not competent enough to coach an NBA team and it‚Äôs becoming more obvious every game. 

No matter who they trade for, Ham will prevent the team from contending. 

He is a terrible defensive coach, he doesn‚Äôt run any plays, there is no movement on offense, he doesn‚Äôt know when to call a timeout or how to adjust in late game situations. 

Any success of this Lakers team is purely a result of phenomenal play from LeBron and Davis this season. 

Based on LeBron‚Äôs and Davis‚Äô attitude last game and in interviews we can make an assumption that some decision has been made regarding the future of this team. 

Maybe Anthony Davis received the news that he will require a surgery.

Maybe the Lakers are in talks to trade Anthony Davis before the deadline. 

Maybe the Lakers have informed LeBron James that they will not make any moves to improve the roster now or during the summer. 

Maybe LeBron informed the Lakers that this is his final season in Los Angeles.

Taking on longer term money is the key. In the perfect world, you invest 1 FRP w Russ to get long term money on the books.

I simply do not have faith that he can stay on the floor. Its actually insane to think he can definitely stay healthy and lead us into the playoffs. All teams need injury luck but we need a near miracle for him to play at an MVP level healthy after the last few years leading up to last night.

I think if someone is offering shooters, wings, and/or picks then we need to at least listen. What if we can get a combo of OG / GTJ / van fleet and still dump Russ in a separate trade? What if we can get Durant? 

I think most would agree its worth listening but I think we give ourselves higher odds if we take the risk. He is no longer a reliable star.",1.0

6833,2023-02-09 05:10:54,10xm5wi,This might be the most offensively talented roster Lebron has ever played with,Academic-Principle14,"The best roster Lebron ever had was the ‚Äò12-‚Äò13 Heat with Wade, Bosh, Chalmers, Allen, Haslem, Birdman, Battier, Cole, and  Miller

Let‚Äôs compare.

Healthy AD &gt; 2013 Wade

Bosh was a better player than Rui is right now but it‚Äôs not a stretch to say that Rui can match Bosh‚Äôs actual production from that season (he only averaged 12 PPG in the playoffs and played solid D) 

DLO &gt; Mario Chalmers

Schroeder/Beverly &gt; Norris Cole

Ray Allen &gt; Malik Beasley

Vanderbilt is better on D than Haslem but Haslem is the better offensive player

Birdman was better than TB on D but I‚Äôll take TB on offense

And the remaining guys are Lonnie Walker, Austin Reaves, Troy Brown, and Shane Battier


The main reason being that Bron and Wade‚Äôs play styles weren‚Äôt really complimentary to one another. Bron/AD/DLo is literally a perfect combination. 

The ‚Äò13 Heat had more shooters, but I think the new Lakers are better at the top. This team has 4 guys who can legitimately create high % shots for themselves (Lebron/AD/DLO/Rui)

6840,2023-02-09 05:52:24,10xmxo0,From a Wolves perspective: Here's what you are getting in D'Lo/Vando/Beasley,mr_purrfect,"Hello Lakers reddit, I come in peace. I've watched every Wolves game over the past 3 seasons (since Edwards was drafted) and thought you might want a little bit of information about your new guys. After all, you now have 4/7 of the best players on the Wolves from last year! That team had great chemistry and I think this will help minimize some of the growing pains which can come with trades.

Now, onto the players...

- **D'Angelo Russell**: A guy the Lakers are certainly familiar with, he's leaving the Wolves at maybe his highest point with the team. His shooting has been insane lately and he has been a major part of the team winning without KAT. With this said, it feels like a good chunk of the fan base is happy to see him gone. His basketball IQ is high but his effort on the court goes through major lapses that can last weeks or even months. This clip - https://streamable.com/jdsw3d - is a perfect example and stuff like this has happened more times than I can remember. Also, get used to the transition pull up 3 with no offensive rebounders under the basket. He's also a huge negative rebounding the ball despite his big size and wing span for a guard.

- **Jarred Vanderbilt**: Low effort... that's a phase that doesn't exist in Vando's vocabulary. The guy has Rodman like traits and is an insane rebounder. Add in that he is a great perimeter defender for his size and he's one of the more underrated players in the NBA. His biggest weakness with the Wolves was shooting, but his time in Utah has helped to expand his offensive game outside of the paint from non-existent to below average. He's a fun player to have on your team and to cheer for.

- **Malik Beasley**: This guy has one NBA skill... shoot 3s and shoot a lot of them. His dribble drive game improved somewhat in Utah but it's still below average. He is a unique player and his frequent comparison when he played for the Wolves was Duncan Robinson. I would say he's a better defender than Duncan but has a much lower IQ on the court. He will shoot you into games and also shoot you out of them. He was a somewhat frustrating player to cheer for because when his shots aren't falling you want him to take a seat... but that doesn't always happen.

Hope you guys found these insightful and good luck the rest of the season! I think you will really like Vando in particular, we miss him with the Wolves and he is on a great contract.",1.0

LeBron and AD are a given. It seems the lakers like hachimura starting next to AD, but with Vanderbilt on the squad he‚Äôs also certainly an option for the front court.

In the back court I would assume Russell starts, but who would be next to him? As much as I like Beasley offensively, his defense is not what we want next to Russell. Maybe start Austin reaves? Schroeder might be an option but we need a point guard coming off the bench. What do y‚Äôall think?",1.0

SF | James | 36 | Walker or Brown | 12
PF | Vanderbilt | 24 | Hachimura | 24
C | Davis | 36 | Bamba | 12
.  
btw I think Vanderbilt is our best wing-stopper, so even though I have him listed as the starting PF, I think he'll be guarding the SF instead of LeBron when they're on the court together.  

Not sure if Walker or Brown will be the backup SF, but it probably doesn't matter too much because I don't think either will be playing in the playoffs.  
  
Lastly, I have a sneaking suspicion that Ham is going to want to close games with LBJ/AD/Reaves/DLo/Schroder...

When the coaching staff struggled with Westbrook‚Äôs unwillingness to be held accountable for his play, Westbrook wasn‚Äôt hearing it.",kai_123,"Lots of interesting tidbits here by Amick and Buha about Lakers lock room dynamics and Westbrook's ultimate departure. Worth a read.

&gt;The situation had become untenable over the past week or so, multiple team and league sources close to the situation told The Athletic, all of whom were granted anonymity so that they could speak freely. Two sources described the situation as ‚Äútoxic.‚Äù And while Lakers owner Jeanie Buss was known to be against the idea of waiving Westbrook, sources say there was a strong sense from the coaching staff that it might be necessary if no trade was forthcoming. 

&gt;Lakers coaches had grown frustrated with Westbrook‚Äôs recent behavior, and he was known to be upset with being openly mentioned in trade discussions. Both sides were ready to move on from an imperfect partnership.

&gt;Tension had been rising inside the Lakers‚Äô locker room with James‚Äô scoring record, the team‚Äôs inconsistency and the trade deadline looming, as demonstrated by the silent, awkward atmosphere before and after losses in New Orleans and against Oklahoma City ‚Äì the latter despite James passing Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. James‚Äô pro-Irving tweets, postgame ‚Äúduh‚Äù comment in New Orleans and interview with ESPN about being disappointed in not trading for Irving added even more eyes on the Lakers‚Äô internal dynamics.

&gt;During the second quarter of Tuesday‚Äôs 133-130 loss to the Thunder, Westbrook and assistant coach Phil Handy had a verbal confrontation on the sideline ‚Äî their second in roughly a month ‚Äî which eventually earned the Lakers a delay of game warning. That upset the bench and led to a more contentious argument between Westbrook and head coach Darvin Ham during intermission, as first reported by ESPN on Wednesday.

&gt;Halftime of Westbrook‚Äôs Lakers finale was an emblematic ending to his time with the franchise. Ham went, well, HAM on the entire team because of its porous defensive effort in the first half. The Lakers had given up 76 first-half points to a young Thunder team that entered play averaging just 58.1 points in every other first half of this season.

&gt;But when Ham turned his attention to Westbrook and his specific individual struggles, sources say the future Hall of Famer appeared to take it personally. As had been the case so many times before, when the coaching staff struggled with Westbrook‚Äôs unwillingness to be held accountable for his play, Westbrook wasn‚Äôt hearing it.

&gt;Ham, sources say, was upset at a number of on-court developments from the first half. But the final straw, it seems, was Westbrook‚Äôs choice to walk off the court so slowly after he was replaced late in the second quarter. For both parties, the topic of great disagreement centered on respect ‚Äî or lack thereof. In the end, with the tension in the room adding to the toxicity of their environment yet again, they agreed to disagree.

&gt;From both ends of this spectrum ‚Äì Westbrook‚Äôs maneuvering with Washington, James and Davis exerting their influence on the Lakers ‚Äì this was a superstar-driven trade if ever there was one. It was a partnership born out of a power play, one that would ultimately prove costly to the Lakers in ways that went well beyond what they gave up in the deal (Kuzma, Harrell, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and the draft rights to Isiaah Jackson, the No. 22 pick in the 2021 draft).

&gt;Former Lakers coach Frank Vogel paid a price for the Westbrook addition, as his inability to inspire total buy-in from the future Hall of Famer was a significant factor in his April 2022 firing. Never mind that he was just 18 months removed from leading the Lakers to the storied franchise‚Äôs 17th title in the Orlando bubble.

&gt;Once James started publicly declaring that he wanted a reunion with Irving, it became clear that Westbrook‚Äôs feelings were not top of mind for the franchise centerpiece.  Everyone knew that an Irving trade with the Nets would have ended Westbrook‚Äôs Lakers tenure, with him likely going to a third team because the Nets did not want him, league sources say.

&gt;Yet James sent that conspicuously-timed tweet on Friday, sharing the eyes-wide-open emoji and a champion‚Äôs crown not long after Irving asked for a trade out of Brooklyn. The following day, when James was asked if Irving would help the Lakers, he made his view more transparently known by deeming it a ‚Äòduh‚Äô question. After Irving was traded to Dallas on Sunday, he told ESPN‚Äôs Michael Wilbon that he was ‚Äúdisappointed‚Äù the Lakers didn‚Äôt land his former running mate. Within the Lakers‚Äô walls, there was some sympathy for the position Westbrook was put in as a result of James‚Äô messaging, and confusion as to why James chose to use his voice in that way.

Rob did a tremendous job in trading for some better pieces and making us stronger for sure, but the biggest is the removal of the cancer!   Russ being gone (by itself) will propel the lakers to play better, have more energy and freedom to play with joy!  THAT alone will make a huge difference.

&gt; ‚ÄúIt was bothering me; it was very painful,‚Äù Davis said. ‚ÄúThe doctor told me that I had a fracture and a bone spur in my foot. At that moment, and maybe leading into the next day, it was tough for me mentally just because of the fact that coming off last year with the injuries and coming out and having a mindset of getting back to who I want to be as a player, in that mold, and for something like this to happen was tough mentally.

It also is a more complicated injury than usual 

&gt; Davis‚Äô injury is threefold. The bone spur fractured off the navicular bone and he‚Äôs also dealing with the stress reaction. Davis said he‚Äôd ‚Äúprobably‚Äù need surgery this offseason to remove the bone spur, which one doctor told Davis could‚Äôve developed as early as college. Fractures in the navicular bone are considered a serious injury, often requiring surgery and lengthy recovery periods.

And yet, he‚Äôs still playing through games and likely trying to avoid any further damage by pacing himself at times. 

&gt; ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like surgery,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI feel like, if it can be avoided, then let‚Äôs avoid it. When that became an option, I wanted to make sure I get the best understanding for me because I‚Äôm the one who has to make the decision with that.‚Äù

Sarunas was from the Warriors in the early to mid 90s. Run TMC days with Mullin, Hardaway, Richmond. He was the 6th man and look at his numbers...91-92, 92-93 dude was fire, nearly 20ppg off the bench, 54% fg and cant hit 3s to save his life. Loved him.

Lebron and Rui both are 3/4s and we ideally shouldn‚Äôt have to see ANY minutes of them at the 5. 

Bamba is a true 5. He‚Äôs a legit 7 footer with an insane wingspan who can block shots and protect the paint at least better than TB could. On offense he spaces the floor for us too at the 5.

AD has played almost exclusively the 5 for us this season, but with the addition of Bamba, I‚Äôd like to see him a little more in that 4 role that he was in next to Javale/Dwight for at least a couple of minutes. AD at the 5 sometimes has him contest a shot, and since he‚Äôs contesting, we don‚Äôt have a big to crash the glass. Bamba is a big body so AD can do his thing defensively without worrying as much about giving up the board. Plus he can still effectively be the 5 on offense. Even if it‚Äôs only for a couple minutes a game, I‚Äôd like to see it. Against a team like the Bucks who run Giannis and Lopez, this would be especially important.

Wenyen to me is also a 4/5 and switchy defensively. I am afraid he will get stuck at the end of the rotation.

Vanderbilt is the most unique since he‚Äôs just SO versatile defensively. He‚Äôll likely be the 4 on offense, but defensively he can guard 3s, 4s, and even 5s. Even some guards too if needed.

Thoughts on our front court rotation? Would you like to see AD/Bamba line-ups? Who should start? Personally, I think Vanderbilt.

Although, I‚Äôd love to see Beasley at the 4! (I‚Äôm kidding someone please tell Darvin Ham I‚Äôm kidding)",1.0

Lakers manage to bring 5 guys who's serviceable and make this team atleast a play-in tournament team. On paper, the Lakers are now a good 3pt shooting team. Its up to Ham to make this work with him now having shooters that can expand his plays.

CHEMISTRY is one of the big factors that helped the Lakers on their last Championship run. That roster was having dinners, taco tuesdays, party and have hang most times. That team was fun. I think that Javale Mcgee, Jared Dudley, and Rajon Rondo have been instrumental in creating that chemistry within the locker room, on the court and off the court. With Russel Westbrook out of the roster, the big elephant in the room is now nowhere to be found and trade rumors is over, the player must now eye on finishing strong.

His shooting has been the best it‚Äôs been since his all star yeat, nearly shooting 50/40/90 in 2023 so far. DLo consistently went on stretches either in the 1st Q or 4th, (known for being clutch) of 14 points straight. Playing behind Kat and Ant was difficult since they are both ball dominant. Gobert couldn‚Äôt catch a pass w his brick hands. LeBron and AD will have life so much easier having DLo on the court.

But anyone here who thinks Rui has been a better fit with the team than Kuzma back then?

Offensively, he doesn't go off for 30-40 like Kuzma, but he also doesn't outshoot the team and looks very steady with his offense even with less touches and even if you surround him with multiple scorers/ball-handlers.

He also doesn't make mistakes often and has done a great job bailing out the team when the offense gets stagnant. It's like when he gets the ball, you know it's an automatic bucket or simply just a non-stupid play.

Rui's size is always felt as well. His rebounding has kept a lot of plays alive and his defense has been a positive for the team.

Do you think Rui is a better fit? Is it because Rui is more comfortable off the ball? Or maybe it has something to do with expectation since Kuzma was expected to be a third star? What are your thoughts?",1.0

Starting.

DLo
Rui
Lebron
AD 
Mo Bamba (since AD doesn‚Äôt want to play center all the time)

Good defense, good shooting, and good size

Our dedicated sixth man should be Reaves, the dude just have energy and can flat out play.
I like Reaves better than Schr√∂der. But it is most likely we will play Schroder as sixth man unless we start him, which would be so dumb.

So second units: 
Schr√∂der
Reaves
Vanderbilt
Beasley
T-Brown

Loonies might get very little minutes. Since the roster is so stacked.

Limit Lebron and AD minutes, if we are blowing out teams until playoff.

But the closing lineup:

DLO or Reaves depend on who is hot
Lebron 
Rui
Vanderbilt 
AD

Lock down defensive squad, with so much shooting and offense.

This team could win it all if healthy.

Hopefully with so much bodies, we can pull it off.

Having Vando waiting on the bench will be a strong motivator for Rui to play with intensity. 

Vando should be our wing stopper, he has the speed, the length, the footwork and fundementals to put an opposing wing in hell. Guys like KD, Luka, Kawhi are in for a long night. He will wear them down and make them miserable. If he gets in foul trouble, we still have Rui to take the assignment.

7217,2023-02-12 21:02:21,110q73m,Russell Westbrick is a great guy people,RlP-Juice_wrld-999," 

Russell Westbrook loved basketball more than anything else in the world. From a young age, he dreamed of becoming a professional basketball player and making it to the big leagues.

As he grew up, Westbrook dedicated himself to the sport, spending hours practicing and working on his skills. Despite his best efforts, however, he never seemed to be as good as some of the other players on his team.

Westbrook often felt inadequate and frustrated with his performance on the court. No matter how hard he tried, he always seemed to fall short. He began to wonder if he would ever be good enough to achieve his dreams.

One day, after a particularly disappointing game, Westbrook sat alone in the locker room, feeling dejected. He couldn't shake off the feeling of being bad at basketball, no matter how hard he tried.

As he pondered his inadequacy, he saw a TV report about the water crisis in Africa. The images of the children struggling to find clean water moved him deeply. Suddenly, his personal problems felt trivial.

Westbrook knew he wanted to help. He had the resources, and he knew he could make a difference. He decided to donate a significant amount of his earnings, an incredible 50 million dollars, to water charities in Africa.

As Westbrook made the donation, he felt a weight lifted off his shoulders. He realized that basketball wasn't everything, and that he could use his skills and resources to help others. He started to feel proud of himself, not for his basketball abilities, but for the difference he could make in the world.

The announcement of Westbrook's donation caused a media frenzy, and many people reached out to congratulate him. But Westbrook remained humble. He didn't want to draw attention to himself; he just wanted to help those in need.

As the news of his donation spread, Westbrook began to receive letters and messages from people across the world, thanking him for his generosity. The outpouring of support and gratitude was overwhelming, and Westbrook felt proud of the impact he was making.

Despite the positive response, however, Westbrook still felt a twinge of self-doubt. He wondered if he was doing enough, if there was more he could be doing to make a difference in the world.

To address his doubts, Westbrook decided to visit Africa and see the impact of his donation firsthand. He traveled to several countries, meeting with local communities and organizations to learn more about the water crisis.

As he saw the struggle and hardship that so many people faced, Westbrook realized that he could use his platform and resources to make a difference. He committed himself to working even harder, to using his skills and talents to help others.

Westbrook returned from his trip to Africa with a renewed sense of purpose. He knew that he wanted to continue to make a difference in the world, to use his resources to help those in need.

Over the next few years, Westbrook continued to work with water charities and organizations to make a difference in the world. He traveled to various countries, meeting with local communities and leaders, and learning more about the issues that affected them.

As he worked to make a difference, Westbrook found that he was growing as a person as well. He was no longer defined solely by his basketball skills, but by his dedication to making the world a better place.

Despite the many challenges he faced, Westbrook remained committed to his cause. He knew that he could make a difference in the world, and that he had a responsibility to use his resources to help others.

As he continued his philanthropic efforts, Westbrook realized that he had found his true calling in life. He was no longer just a basketball player, but a humanitarian, a leader, and a role model.

Westbrook's dedication to making a difference inspired countless others, both on and off the court. His generosity and commitment to philanthropy earned him the admiration and respect of people around the world.

As Westbrook's influence grew, he began to use his platform to raise awareness about a variety of social issues. He worked with other athletes and celebrities to advocate for causes like education, healthcare, and social justice.

Through his efforts, Westbrook became a powerful force for good in the world. He inspired people everywhere to use their skills and resources to make a difference, and he proved that anyone, regardless of their background or circumstances, could have a positive impact on the world.

Over time, Westbrook's legacy grew beyond his athletic accomplishments. He was remembered not only for his skills on the court but also for his generosity, his compassion, and his unwavering commitment to making a difference in the world.

Years later, long after Westbrook had retired from basketball, people would still talk about the impact he had made, the lives he had touched, and the change he had brought about in the world.

And though he had once felt inadequate and frustrated by his basketball skills, Westbrook knew that his true calling had been to use his resources to help others. In the end, it was his philanthropy, not his basketball, that defined him as a person and made him a true legend in the eyes of the world.",1.0

7222,2023-02-12 22:26:08,110s4k9,Schroeder and DLo,BlueRaj,"Last year the Wolves were one of the best defenses in the league when they paired Patrick Beverley and DLo. Why? Because DLo is too slow to be a point of attack defender on fast guards. Beverley filled that role. DLo is also big and long enough to guard 2s much better than 1s. Schroeder on the other hand is very fast and picks up opposing ball-handlers over the entire court. When the starters were announced before yesterday‚Äôs game, I was appalled by Ham starting both of these guys. Thinking it over, it makes a bit more sense now. DLo is more of a combo guard that can control the offense if he needs to. Schroeder is the same to a lesser degree. Neither are true PGs next to Lebron but can fill that role.

Schroeder‚Äôs best season had him as the 6th man on the Thunder. That year the Thunder had one of the best closing line-ups statistically. That lineup had CP3-Schroeder-SGA. 3 ball handlers who could create. I hate the idea of a 3-guard lineup (especially small ones), but luckily we have Lebron James. So a 2 guard pairing with Schroeder-DLo next to Lebron can emulate what made that Thunder lineup so successful, while being much bigger.

Now I still probably prefer like Reaves next to DLo instead, but his own natural position is PG anyways, so him being the PG off the bench still works. Obviously things are very flexible. If the Schroeder-DLo pairing starts to look awful like people originally thought, then absolutely stop it. If one of them is cold, close with someone else, we have options now. But I actually don‚Äôt mind this pairing for now. Given these specific players, we‚Äôve seen them be most successful in situations most similar to this.

&amp;#x200B;

NBA Cap for next season is $134M with a Luxury Tax that starts around $165M. Lakers are both repeaters, and almost a full max contract above the cap. 

Regardless though, the roster is basically fine for the next year so long as we negotiate good deals with our guys. The Tax Payer MLE could go to Shroeder and we basically run it back this year. If Anthony Brown takes another Vet Min, he'll have early-bird rights. I think we move on from Lonnie Walker and Shroeder and use the MLE to try to sign a starting SG/SF. 

The Nuggets' Bruce Brown kind of perfectly fits what we need despite his 6""4 height.  

**The real issue is more about Laker's spending. My thoughts below:** 

I could see us trying to make some cuts to avoid a $60M Luxury Tax bill. 

For starters, getting discounts on Russell, Hachimura, Reaves as I listed is good. 

If they aren't successful there, I could see the Lakers guaranteeing Beasly's $16M for his final year, trading him an under the Cap Team and taking the trade exception and some 2nd rounders. Or just allowing him to expire and use a TP-MLE to save $10M on that roster spot.

That would drop the Lakers Luxury Tax into the $20-30M range.

I'm not worried much on Lakers cheeping out a ton. For one, the Luxury Tax is calculated at the end of the season. The likelihood that our entire roster that's making over $8M is healthy and contributing is low. If we need to drop someone and grab a vet, we'll have three rookies to dangle and we're fine with 2nd rounders. 

If they are? The Lakers can manage one year of overpayment. Especially if it gives them something to whine about going into CBA Negotiations. They can say, look, we want to make sure that the league isn't just ultra billionaires using outside money to prop up contenders is broken. And when someone like LeBron or Kobe comes along, dropping a valuable player that's only $10M but will make the difference of $70M in tax payments is also broken. 

It hurts ownership of an NBA team.

That's a big down payment on getting rid of onerous Luxury Tax Payments that really do hamper the Buss family's ability to profit AND compete. 

Two years of fielding this roster might not work. But after that, there's relief anyways. LeBron won't be getting $50M from the Lakers.",1.0

Luke Walton is super stubborn and bad rotation.
Ham actually beats him in those department, I didn‚Äôt even know it is possible.

We messed up not getting Lue.
Never should have let Vogel go.
Though one thing about Vogel annoyed me is how he only make adjustment a bit slow, like how he almost purposely lose game 1 in the playoff.  But he is like a genius compare to Ham.

Ham is in love with player just small guards lineup.

And when we traded away all the smart guards, he still finds a way to play the only 2 point guards we have together starting. Makes me want to rage and throw something at him. It is like he is purposely sabotaging our season.

We need to fire him like tomorrow.
I just can‚Äôt watch this.
The dude is really clueless.
Our front officer hired him really show incompetency too. We hired Luke too.

And also it is over for Lebron.
The NBA wants him to fade into the retirement.
The ref this year cost us like multiple games, without that, we would not be in a must win every gam until playoff.

The Boston game made it clear to me.
NBA needs new superstar to take over.

They can‚Äôt have the Jordan thing happen again where he retired after winning, and the rating all drop to bottom.

Same thing happened to Kobe, NBA literally stopped the Chris Paul trade to make sure Kobe slowly fade into irrelevance in term of winning.

When you are too big of a star, the NBA had learnt from Michael Jordan mistake that it needs you to fade into the shadow instead going out with a bang, and bring viewership down when u retire.

NBA is a business and it needs focus on creating new super stars like the Boston pairs.",1.0

7332,2023-02-15 04:40:40,112pmot,An Anthony Davis Descriptive Analytics Breakdown: Fro vs No Fro,kiwiwikikiwiwikikiwi,"Anthony Davis has played in 34 games this season. 5 of those games have been with a fro. He has played in 29 other games with braids. 

As some have observed, Fro AD plays more passive and inefficient, so I wanted to see how the numbers look. And below are the general stat findings for this season: 

&amp;#x200B;

||PTS|REB|FG%|3PT%|FT%|BLK|STL|TO|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|FRO|21.2|**15.2**|48.2|0|78.8|**2.2**|.6|**3.4**|
|NO FRO|**26.8**|11.9|**55.5**|**25.5**|**80.5**|2.0|**1.3**|2.0|

Fro AD in his last 4 games has been shadow of his normal self. The only outlier of the 5 games total is fro AD during November 18th, where he scored 38 pts and 16 rebounds on 62.5% FG. Remove this game and he is actually averaging **17 pts and 15 rebounds on 44% FG** in the 4 fro games post-injury. Dreadful.

AD with braids (""Brai-D"") is still an all-star caliber player. But will he cut his hair in time to save the season? We'll just have to wait and see.

But this was me just wondering how badly he was playing ever since he switched hairstyles (and really his foot injury that has screwed him over). Wanted to share the pretty obvious findings. Lemme know what you think! 

For the next breakdown, I might wanna look at the numbers and coaching schemes for when Darvin Ham decided to let the offense run through our guards (Dennis/Reaves/Lonnie) instead of...you know...our superstar championship duo in Bron/AD. Because imagine you are a coach in the NBA, and are given 2 top 10 players in the league, and you decide to prioritize touches for your role players instead...

But anyways, hope the big guy can recover to 80-90% of himself. Cause we're really gonna need him if we hope to make the play-ins and beyond.

7353,2023-02-15 22:29:06,113ah87,AD is a 4 not a 5. When are they going to realize that?,Barnnz,"AD hates playing the 5. That is one reason to stop doing it. If a player hates doing something, you're not getting their best effort. But further to this, you're removing AD's best skill: **HELP DEFENSE**

AD cannot play drop coverage and then help all in the same possession. It is physically impossible for any human to do this. AD is the best help defender in the world and we're taking him totally away from performing that skill. That is madness. 

Back track to the championship season, AD was flying in on help defense to block shots and protect the rim. You don't even need a good C next him. Just someone to stop the ball for a second or two to allow AD to recover from the perimeter and help.

Last reason to not start him at C: **Screens.** AD does not make contact or screens or even attempt to make contact. Why? I don't know. Every single other 5 man in the league can make contact at least a little bit. Maybe this is way of showing the coaching staff he hates playing C. This one is baffling. The lack of contact on screens hurts the guards scoring creation. Mainly D'Lo's pull up game. Get Bamba in there setting hard screens please.

The lineup should be:  


PG: D'lo

SG: Reaves/Beasley

SF: LeBron

PF: Davis

We invested so much support, confusion, years w the young core which didn‚Äôt really give off on the grand scheme of things (Except for 2020) , Kobe hugging the trio on his last game, DLo being our ‚Äúfuture superstar‚Äù years ago, etc., 

And just seeing talks of a contract extension gives me a little tickle in my heart, you know? (Too corny, I‚Äôm sorry)

A ring with DLo would really have a full circle for the Byron Scott tank commander era. All the years we spent hoping a young LA drafted superstar would take us to the promised land. We may not get that specifically, but with DLo as our PG plus a ring (here‚Äôs to hoping). So much sweeter than 2020. 

I myself dont like recency bias because of the win, he‚Äôll surely have bad games here and there, but I hope he gets better fan support from us. 

I hope he stays with us and I still hope he turns into a superstar. An LA drafted superstar CHAMPION. (Soon, hopefully.)

7443,2023-02-16 19:51:25,113zct1,Beasley as a starter,TipsyOtter,"First off, great to see such a dominant performance last night. 

I know a lot of people want to see Reaves as a starter and that may still happen as Ham changes starting lineups seemingly every game. But I believe Beasley as a starter is a good thing. The gravity Beasley brings as a 3pt threat opens up lanes for our big 3. Alternatively, our big 3 allows for volume shooters like Beasley to get the shot going early. It‚Äôs a nice recipe for good 1st quarter performances such as last night. Not to mention Beasley‚Äôs defense wasn‚Äôt too bad either. 

As for Reaves, he could very easily be a starter and I wouldn‚Äôt argue very hard with anyone if they pushed for it. But I‚Äôve always liked Reaves decision making as it seems he‚Äôs able to make the right play or organize the offense when our stars are out. That and he‚Äôs a bit of a Swiss Army knife in terms of molding his game positively given the lineup. He knows how to be aggressive on the second unit but also knows how to be a complementary player when playing with our stars. That‚Äôs something Beasley probably can‚Äôt do as he‚Äôs more of a one dimensional player. 

TLDR: Beasleys good as a starter because shooting. Reaves is a good second unit guy cuz he‚Äôs more versatile.",1.0

Aside from that let‚Äôs talk playoff aspirations. Currently 13th, but we‚Äôre 3.5 games back from the 6th seed and 2 games back from 10th. With the all star break this weekend, and our next game being next Thursday, this puts us in an excellent position to rest, practice and gel with the new guys, and build that continuity and chemistry we‚Äôve been lacking.

Furthermore, we might need to use the TPMLE to keep one of Dennis or Troy, considering how mid to weak the FA class is this summer.

Therefore, the most intriguing question (and one that I‚Äôm surprised many people haven‚Äôt discussed here already) is who we‚Äôre going to select with that first-round pick. Assuming that we‚Äôre the 7th-10th seed and that the Pelicans stay close to us in the standings, our pick is probably going to be somewhere around #25.

Personally, I‚Äôd like to get another two-way stopper who can guard the elite guards in the West (ala KCP/Caruso), while Vando and AD can stay on the bigger players. 

One of the few weaknesses of this current roster imo is that we don‚Äôt have a player that can effectively guard someone like Booker, for example. Vando can guard 1-5, but if he‚Äôs guarding Booker, who‚Äôs guarding KD? AD can certainly do it, but having someone who can more exclusively guard those quick guards and free Vando to more exclusively defend bigger wing players would be great, imo.",1.0

I was watching the other night and now we have the new trio in the lineup, they seem super confident and self sufficient, also they get AD going. The second unit now you could say is comprised of talented guys who maybe are quiet, or lack confidence.

I was just wondering what would happen if we put Lebron in that unit? The starters come out and play, Lebron gets to rest and then when he comes in he can get the other guys going. He‚Äôd be dominant, maybe playing against some bench players from the other team and he draws so much attention Austin, Rui etc would be open a lot.

Is the answer that if he was on the bench to start, him not being out there would make us way worse and the opponents would be too strong? 

Just curious if anyone thinks that would work. Obviously this would be assuming that it‚Äôs Brons idea or he‚Äôs cool with it lol",1.0

We can get away with playing multiple guards this time because they're all threats from 3 (and are between 6'4"" and 6'6"" in height), and even then it'll most likely be situational because we're finally deep on the wings.

In my opinion, he‚Äôs got Dikembe Mutumbo-like shot blocking abilities with prime Rudy Gobert rim protection. His motor is one of the highest in the league (look how amped up he was in 16 minutes in his Laker debut). With the right pieces around him, I believe he is first team all-defense next season. His defensive metrics are off the charts with how good he is. His active hands on defense always has him creating headaches for opponents when he slashes the ball away from them. 

He could very well be the best shooting big man in the entire NBA. It wouldn‚Äôt be surprising to see him hit shots like Robert Horry in a big playoff series. He has virtually unlimited range from deep and does not hesitate to pull the trigger. With a 7‚Äô10‚Äù wingspan, he is also a massive threat to slam lobs and play down low, where he loves to bang bodies and grab offensive boards. This frees up AD to do what he wants, while Mo does the dirty work. He reminds me of a better shooting Joel Embiid on defense m. 

My guess is he starts alongside LeBron, Davis, and Russell to create one of the greatest Big 4s the game has ever seen. I could see him finishing out the year as a 22/12/3/3/3 guy.",1.0

7664,2023-02-24 17:26:04,11awtgq,D Russell is biggest x factor between play in / early playoff loss and real contention,Empathetic_Walrus,"Two things:

- of course we need to stay healthy, obviously that is the biggest factor for any team

- our bench / role players are legitimately good. Reeves, Hachimura, and Dennis can play real playoff minutes 

Which leads me to the biggest factor of this season - Russell. Watching the game last night I found myself thinking man if we had Kyrie (putting aside baggage and just focusing on talent) we would be in the inner circle of contenders.

With Russell I'm not sure what to expect. He can be 60% as good or 85% as good as kyrie. Early returns are promising. He seems motivated. His ceiling IMO determines it all. Against Phoenix or Denver in a series we need him to be 20+ a game consistently.

Everyone else (assuming decent health) feels predictable and we know what were getting.",1.0

Now with Vando shinning, call me crazy, but he seems like the kind to sulk just because he's coming off the bench.

His game today was indicative of this.  I don't think he has a team mentality that we need him to have to contribute to our ultimate goal.  Very Dennis 20-21 vibes when he came in acting like an entitled starter.  

He needs to make a case for himself and prove he deserves to be a starter... not that I think he should be with Vando here now.  But he at least strive for it and let this game talk.  I fear he'll sulk.",1.0

Ran the program for our five man lineups against the Mavs, some things I noticed:

Darvin Ham has been good at picking our starting lineup, leading the team at +12.

AD had a monster impact, being a part of the top 6 starting lineups. 

Lebron + the bench struggled tonight, possible due to Walker taking the place of Schroder, as Schroder had to cover for Dlo being out.

&amp;#x200B;

Darvin Ham has been playing around with quite a lot of lineups. Our strongest lineups seem to comprise of Schroder-Vando-Bron-AD, with either Beasley or Reaves filling that fifth player. This may be skewed against Dlo since he only played one game with the Pelicans and got injured early in the Warriors game. Look forward to seeing how he performs with the team against the Grizzlies. Vando-Bron-AD remain a winning formula.",1.0

Next, holy shit the difference it makes when the leaders on the team step it up. So i just want to note something: everyone said AD played horrible against GSW(Away Game @ Warriors). He had just come back and had a fairly underwhelming first half. 3rd was a little better. However, then hit the final 6 or so minutes in the 4th, and this dude locked in: you could feel he's physically trying to exert himself(both ends of the floor), talking shit to Draymond, getting good looks--a notable shift in intensity. The entirety of the team followed suit. Its like the team helped him hang in there, doing team shit, and this dude comes back and puts them over the edge by himself. He was seriously terrifying the other team. Warriors were on the lookout for this dude at every corner. Divincenzo got him shit moved, Klay got his shit moved. DAMN

This game against the Mavs, it was both LeBron and AD in the second half... you could literally feel through the screen how bad LeBron wanted it, especially in the post(PAUSE)(""aye bruh is this dude 15 or somn)(fuck u oldass)(fuck hes corny)(fuck is he gonna stop now).  Its like he cuts down on excessive movements and gets crazy precise. Now you have a third guy, who keeps that intensity up ALL the time.. energy wise.. this team is seriously, different as fuck,6 man swap aside). It is just so crazy how important leaders like them are. I am genuinely so happy they are teammates. Kobe and LeBron on the same team.. it would be so fun to watch even one season of it. Kobe would have brought that out in him every 4th quarter, Olympics doc hit different. 

Anyway, this is just how good they can be, especially in the playoffs. I cannot wait to see them in the post-season again. Please, heel (hehe). hastily. (alliteration)

Ik its a very obvious take but its true and I feel like it gets swept under the rug a lot. They are the most paid dudes on the team, and have to act like it and winning in the playoffs will rely on them mostly due to the 8 man shortened rotation in the playoffs. 

LeNut has to be LeNut, ADisney gotta be that MF

Yesterday in the Mavs game, Vando messed up his ankle coming down with a rebound but I do not think it's serious. Prayers up for this dude he is outstanding and only 4 mil.

Dlo is also hurt but will come back hopefully by Thunder or T-Wolves game. I would have loved to see him play in that mavs game I feel like we would have been tied at half of within 5-8 points instead of 14 if he's out there.

And again, Bron messed up his foot again with a ""pop"". 

Bro I really hope this is not that serious but my gut is telling me that he will be out at least three games and I do not know how to feel about due to us having not that many games left

WE CANNOT CATCH A BREAK W INJURIES BRO AND IT PISSES ME OFF

WE HAD TWO GAMES WITH THE WHOLE SQUAD FUCKING TWO GAMES AND NOW BRON IS PROLLY OUT WITH DLO.

Look I know injuries are apart of the game, but at this rate? I feel like our team goes through the most amount of injuries compared to all the other teams and you cannot control so Ik should not being this pressed but I am.

Also the types of injuries seem to be total bullshit they all come from the most avoidable ways but they  happen anyways. Like DLO's??? Come on bro that is just bad luck it not even just a simple way to get injured, it just seems like these injuries are always in the worst way possible

But I still feel like after yesterdays win we will have a momentum going forward and we have gained a lot of chemistry which is amazing

In fact, I‚Äôm just going to say it, since @MITWestbrook has joined the Clippers, Bron has more room to operate inside, leading to a better shot selection at the end of games.

I know Anthony Davis is injury-prone, but his foot injury was reported as a stress injury. Stress injuries are generally due to OVERUSE. 

LeBron‚Äôs injury during the Mavs game was an unlucky circumstance, but he has looked hobbled since he broke the record against the Thunder. 

To a degree, injuries are unavoidable. But to not admit that teams can take steps to mitigate said injuries is completely unfair. If any of you would like to say that the Lakers have done everything they could to lighten LeBron and AD‚Äôs load, you‚Äôd be LYING and just carrying water for the FO.

Simply put, had we made the Turner/Hield trade in the off-season, we would have been much less likely to be in this position. By replacing a NEGATIVE in WestBrick with 2 POSITIVES (including a 26 year old who is having a career year) at the start of the season, we would have been able to both decrease Bron‚Äôs minutes and decrease AD‚Äôs wear by having Turner play more 5. 

Converting Westbrook‚Äôs expiring into some better contracts/bird rights going forward via the Utah trade is still a good move. But remember by waiting to do that trade instead of the Pacers trade at the beginning of the season, we took a gamble and saved the 29‚Äô draft pick, but we ran our stars into the ground. That gamble is currently costing us.

Don't get me wrong, upcoming games are important but we need the rest of the gang to step up. AD has to be that dude and with LeBron out he now has to be that dude.

7998,2023-02-28 11:28:24,11e3qr1,GAMES PLAYED IN THE LAST 5 SEASONS,ThunderClown101,"LeBron James - 270 games played - 54 games per season on average (66% of games)

In his first 15 seasons before joining the Lakers he averaged 76 games per season (92% of games)

Anthony Davis - 231 total games played - 46 games per season on average (56% of games)

In his first 7 seasons before joining the Lakers he averaged 67 games per season (81% of games)

This is the answer to all the Lakers struggles in the LeBron-AD era.   
 

In the last 5 seasons both Lakers superstars have dropped their season average of games played by 20+ games (LeBron went from 76 to 54 games played per season, AD went from 67 to 46).  
 

The shutdown of the league in 2020 was a true miracle for the Lakers. Both LeBron and Davis have not been able to stay on the court and the only time they have gotten themselves a long break during the season, they were able to win a championship.   
 

However this not solely a Lakers‚Äô issue. This has been a trend for many superstars in the last 5 seasons:  
 

Stephen Curry - 239 games played, 48 games per season, 58%.  
 

Kevin Durant - 207 games played, 41 games per season, 50%.

Kawhi Leonard - 205 games played, 41 games per season, 50%. 

Paul George - 256 games played, 51 games per season, 62%. 

When it comes to Davis, Kawhi and George it‚Äôs fair to say that they are just injury-prone players, because the all have been in the 27-32 age span in the last 5 years,  
 

Meanwhile LeBron, Durant and Curry - three greatest players of the last decade have been in the 30-35 age span in the last 5 years, so their injury history can be attributed to age and milage, because all of them have been to many NBA finals in the last decade.  
 

This is still amazing that LeBron James while being the oldest of the group and having played more basketball than anyone in history is still averaging more games per season (66%) than Curry, Leonard, Durant, George and Davis.

It is also notable that LeBron and Curry have both been able to squeeze in a championship in that timespan, given that both players play around 50 games per season. Both the Lakers and the Warriors have taken turns missing the playoffs, but winning the title when they got there once.

Who knows, maybe Kevin Durant or Kawhi Leonard are the next in line to squeeze in a title, while missing 50% of games in a 5 year span.   
 

This makes the most sense given that LeBron James, Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant and Kawhi Leonard are undeniably the 4 greatest players of the past decade.   
 

P.S. 

I am not including Giannis on this list, because he is on the upward trajectory of his carrer - the same spot that LeBron was in 2012 or Curry was in 2016. He will most likely end up being the greatest player of the current decade.",1.0

Yesterday's rooting guide went 1-0 with the Pelicans losing to the Magic at home. Pelicans have now lost 4 in a row and are 4-6 in their last 10 games.

Today has a full slate of games with 5 on the rooting guide so her it is. 

**Rooting Guide.**

1. Kings(-2.5) OVER the Thunder
2. Pacers(+7.5) OVER the Mavericks
3. Spurs(+9.5) OVER the Jazz
4. Clippers(-6.5) OVER the Timberwolves
5. Warriors(-4.5) OVER the Trailblazers

If results go our way, Lakers could move into the 10th seed for the last play-in spot, so today is very important, give the team all your energy today.

Memphis  
OKC  
Timberwolves  
Warriors  
Memphis (again)  


If we managed to go 3-2 our record would be 32-34 which is decent but still in danger of being out of the play in still.  Realistically, Our best possible outcome is to go 4-1 to go 33-33 and have our lost against Memphis since they aren't a contender for the play-ins.   


if we go on a losing record in the next 5 games that will put us in the 13 seed with 16 games remaining. If we are behind more than 4 games during that time, we ain't making it .  


We will be also playing without Lebron during this span. If AD is really a superstar, he has to show it during the next 5 games.  There should be no excuses and no bad games for him. Let's hold him to a standard of a superstar player. Our roles players are deep, but we can't make this work without a superstar push.

Everyone thought jazz would sweep Luka-less Mavericks. Instead Brunson and other guys stepped up and made 2-1 lead against Jazz

Steph hurt himself during April I believe and Warriors were in dangerous spot to clinch the homecourt advantage. However, JP and Klay stepped up with other guys and clinched 3rd seed and even made steph to come out of the bench

I am not saying that we are in their situation since their team already clinched the playoff spot back then but what I am saying is that we can do this too

We got the depth, for forward we got Vando/Rui/Reaves(Possibly)/Gabriel(another possible option) for guards we got DLo as a starter and Dennis as a bench and center we got our best guy AD and Mo Bamba and Gabriel

When AD averages 28/10 and occasionally drop 30-40, than defensively we got dennis, reaves, Vando and AD lineup.

We are already a fine team for the playoff spot without lebron and I definitely think we can beat the team at the verge of .500. Phoenix had Booker, CP3 and KD out and they still fought well against the higher seed teams",1.0

1. Constant starting lineup changes
2. Plays guys playing bad too long
3. Sitting guys too long/not playing them

The last two are the worst ones of them all but let‚Äôs start with the starting lineups. Ham has been changing them too much and there isn‚Äôt a lot of chemistry being built with the lineups, we start offensively bad and take longer to get going. However when he plays Dennis and Troy Brown as much as he did and sees the lack of effort and forcing too much and getting turnovers (Dennis had 6 of the 26), that‚Äôs hurting us. He didn‚Äôt even play Bamba, and played our bad defensive guards on a guard dominant team. Dennis and Lonnie are not playmakers, Reaves is the best substitute for DLO and Lebron that we have. 

This game he put Gabriel out there and we couldn‚Äôt get a board since AD and Vanderbilt were on the bench. Why is he not playing bamba at the 5 and Gabriel at the 4? Especially since Gabriel has not played that much but against a potential title contender you trust him at center more than Bamba (the effort is there but we need size)?

 We got back into the game with our gritty lineup (AD, Vando, Reaves, Beasley, Lonnie) but Ham did not like that apparently. As much as Max Christie is young and inexperienced he is our best perimeter defender besides Vando and maybe Reaves, as well as being a better shooter than Dennis and Lonnie. He needs to play even a little bit in order to see if he‚Äôs capable (which I believe he is but Ham doesn‚Äôt give him a chance). 

Ham has got to start doing better with understanding some guys are playing better and deserve more minutes in a game, and some guys can‚Äôt fit a position they simply can‚Äôt play (Wenyen at center).",0.81

8079,2023-03-01 15:22:13,11f6h1m,Taylor Jenkins just outcoached Darvin last night,Nicoreyn,"One of our main issues this season has been a lack of scheme adjustments after halftime, leading to incredible 3rd quarters from the opponent. 

We watched it happen again last night.

Ja started off 3-14 in the first half; we basically funneled him to AD every play and went under screens in the half court.

That 3rd quarter Ja made it a point to avoid going straight at AD (besides that one tough reverse layup) and we had no answer.

https://youtu.be/yAYZVLrbU3E

Watch Ja‚Äôs buckets in that 3rd. He changed his attack: he goes early in transition (before AD gets back on D) leans heavily on that floater, and kills Austin, Dennis, and Troy on his first step around that screen, so he can just elevate.

Ham‚Äôs first response is always to change WHO is guarding a player instead of HOW we should guard them‚Ä¶ and then the actual right person to guard him (Vando) didn‚Äôt get time on him until late in the 4th.

Dennis was the worst on Ja all night; didn‚Äôt fight through screens causing AD to guard 2 people downhill every play (+Xavier Tilllman was killing on the glass)

I actually think Darvin has been great for this team; but this could be detrimental looking forward to the play in. It‚Äôs rookie coach stuff, comes with it unfortunately.

Thoughts? Am I off base here?",0.69

But if we're not a championship team -- and between Bron's age/health and AD's health/beta personality, I don't know that we are -- I'd kinda love for us to move on sooner rather than later.

What I'd want is for us to do what the Brooklyn Nets did a couple of years ago (and are doing right now) and what the Clippers did before Kawhi/PG: build up a squad of high level, overachieving role players who are either still developing or in their prime.

Then overachieve for a year or two, build a culture, and then try to lure another superstar to be the next billboard Lakers player.

I think part of me also wonders what could've been if we had like Vanderbilt, Caruso, Josh Hart, Gary Payton II, &amp; Austin Reaves all on the same squad. Not as the starting five, but as key glue pieces doing all the dirty work so our stars can shine.",1.0

&gt;TIEBREAKER BASIS FOR TWO-WAY TIES:

&gt;(-) Tie breaker not needed (better overall winning percentage)

&gt;(1) Head-to-head won-lost percentage

&gt;(2) Division leader wins tie from team not leading a division

&gt;(3) Division won-lost percentage for teams in the same division

&gt;(4) Conference won-lost percentage

&gt;(5) W-L Percentage vs. Playoff teams, own conference

&gt;(6) W-L Percentage vs. Playoff teams, other conference

&gt;(7) Net Points, all games

&amp;nbsp;

###Los Angeles Lakers

**Division Record:** 3-9

**Remaining division games:** 3/5 GSW, 3/22 PHX, 4/5 @LAC, 4/7 PHX

&amp;nbsp;

###Golden State Warriors

**Current head-to-head record against the Lakers:** 1-2, plays @LAL 3/5

**Division Record:** 4-7

**Remaining division games:** 3/2 LAC, 3/5 @LAL, 3/13 PHX, 3/15 @LAC, 4/7 @SAC

In order to own the tie-breaker over the Warriors, the Lakers need to win the final game of their season series.  If they lose, it'll come down to who has a better division record.

&amp;nbsp;

###Los Angeles Clippers

**Current head-to-head record against the Lakers:** 3-0, plays LAL 4/5

With a head-to-head record of 3-0, even if the Lakers win the final game of their season series, the Clippers still own the tie-breaker over the Lakers.

&amp;nbsp;

###Dallas Mavericks

**Current head-to-head record against the Lakers:** 2-1, plays @LAL 3/17

**Division Record: 8-2**

Even though there is still a chance to tie the season series at 2-2, due to the Mavericks having a division record of 8-2, even if the Lakers win their 4 remaining division games to bring their division record to 7 wins, the Mavericks would still own the tie-breaker over the Lakers.

&amp;nbsp;

###Minnesota Timberwolves

**Current head-to-head record against the Lakers:** 1-0, plays @LAL 3/3, LAL 3/31

**Division Record:** 8-7

Due to the Timberwolves having a division record of 8-7, even if the Lakers win their 4 remaining division games to bring their division record to 7 wins, the Timberwolves would still have a better division record.  So, the only way the Lakers can own the tie-breaker is if they win the remaining 2 games against the Timberwolves to earn a head-to-head record advantage.

&amp;nbsp;

###Utah Jazz

**Current head-to-head record against the Lakers:** 2-0, plays LAL 4/4, @LAL 4/9

**Division Record:** 5-6

**Remaining division games:** 3/3 @OKC, 3/5 @OKC, 3/22 POR, 4/6 OKC, 4/8 DEN

In order to own the tie-breaker over the Jazz, the Lakers need to win their remaining 2 games against them to advance the tie-breaker to division record --&gt; conference record --&gt; etc.

&amp;nbsp;

###New Orleans Pelicans

**Current head-to-head record against the Lakers:** 1-2, plays LAL 3/14

**Division Record:** 7-4

In order to own the tie-breaker over the Pelicans, the easiest path for the Lakers would be winning the final season series game.  If they cannot do that, the Lakers would need to win their remaining division games while the Pelicans lose all of theirs just to advance the tie-breaker to conference record --&gt; etc.

&amp;nbsp;

###Portland Trail Blazers

**Current head-to-head record against the Lakers:** 2-2

**Division Record:** 5-8

**Remaining division games:** 3/22 @UTA, 3/26 OKC, 4/2 @MIN

In order to own the tie-breaker over the Trail Blazers, the Lakers would need to finish with a better division record or tie them to progress the tie-breaker to conference record --&gt; etc.

&amp;nbsp;

###Oklahoma City Thunder

**Current head-to-head record against the Lakers:** 1-1, plays @LAL 3/24

In order to own the tie-breaker over the Thunder, the Lakers need to win their remaining game against them.  Whoever wins that game will own the tie-breaker.",1.0

8160,2023-03-02 08:05:24,11fx2ly,It's Title Time,threepointcheese,"Dear Laker Hopefuls:

In the history of modern title contention, here is where we stand. Since 1980 (43 years), teams to win the NBA championship with sub 50 wins are:

1. 1995 Rockets, sixth seed (47-35)
2. 2021 Bucks, third seed (46-26)\*
3. 1999 Spurs, first seed (36-13)\*
4. 2012 Heat, second seed (46-20)\*

\*shortened seasons, lock out.

Since 1980, teams to win the NBA championship with a number 1 option over the age of 35 are:

1. None

Only the 1995 Rockets have won a championship with sub 50 wins in a full 82 game season. No NBA team has won a championship with their best player over the age of 35. Given these two damning pieces of evidence, more damning still, the Lakers top three players are not and have not been healthy for the team. No NBA team has won a championship with injuries to their three best players. As LA natives, an intellectual fanbase who convinced only by empirical data to form our opinions, we can arrive at a singular conclusion: The Lakers are not winning another championship in the foreseeable future. All odds are against the Lakers. 

# FUCK. THAT. 

Here is what I see:

1. LeBron James is the greatest floor general in the history of the NBA.
2. LeBron James is the greatest floor general in the NBA today.
3. LeBron and AD are the best duo to play in the league since Shaq and Kobe.

After trading Russell Westbrook, the Lakers have won five out of seven games. Without laboring extensively over permutations and opponent quality, four of these games have been without LeBron James. Two of these games have been without Anthony Davis. 3.75 of these games have been without D'Angelo Russell. In this seven game stretch, Anthony Davis, LeBron James, and D'Angelo Russell have only played one full game together and handily defeated our short term rival, the New Orleans Pelicans, 120-102.

After watching this seven game stretch, here is where I'm at:

1. The Lakers if healthy have an elite lockdown perimeter defender (Jarred Vanderbilt)
2. The Lakers if healthy have an elite lockdown post defender (Anthony Davis)
3. The Lakers if healthy possess the best half court basketball player in the NBA (LeBron James)
4. The Lakers if healthy possess the best front court complement in the NBA (Anthony Davis)
5. The Lakers if healthy possess an 8 man rotation that can demolish or comeback against playoff level teams on any given night
6. The Lakers possess a team that can win against NBA talent without their three best players
7. The Lakers can win in the NBA when LeBron James has an off night

Given the most important factor, that the Lakers possess the ability to string together wins, shorthanded, post all star break, the Lakers, if healthy, are not only a playoff team, but they can also contend in the playoffs with the best teams in the NBA who are as follows: Bucks, Celtics, Sixers, Nuggets, Clippers, Warriors, Suns. No other team is a contender. The listed are the six best teams in the NBA for the historical logic:

1. These teams have won 50 plus games in an 82 game season, or
2. Their number one is a proven champion with multiple championships

Since 1980, only 4 teams in the NBA have won a singular championship. Any wet nosed nephew or casual sports fan can list those teams when pressed. They are the 2021 Bucks, 2011 Mavericks, 2007 Celtics, and 2004 Pistons.  In the last 43 years, 39 championships have been hoarded by number ones as follows: Stephen Curry (4), LeBron James (4), Kawhi Leonard (2), Kobe Bryant (5), Tim Duncan (5), Shaquille O'Neal (4), Michael Jordan (6), Isiah Thomas (2), Larry Bird (3), Magic Johnson (5), Dr. J (3). That is fucking it.

There are no other generational talents. That's fucking it. Those are your generational talents. I don't give a damn about what you think about players, teams, or luck. PG's latest interview articulated it in a round about way, every other superstar since 1980 was a tier two bitch who couldn't win it all and didn't have the self awareness to know it. You're worried about up and comers? Sack the FUCK up. The Celtics, Nuggets, and Sixers have to pull a CHRIST level miracle out their effing a\*\*holes to be a new winner. You're worried about the Clippers, Warriors, and Suns? These teams will not win 50 games in this 82 game season.

In this context, the Bucks are the favorites but have not had their second star. Moreover, the Bucks won when the teams with players with multiple championships were all out of contention due to injuries to the first or second best player on their team: Lakers, AD; Warriors, Klay; Clippers, Kawhi. The Bucks, if they win, solidify that Giannis is in the conversation of talent of the best of the best of all time, but until that happens, the Bucks championship was an outlier. THEREFORE:

No team in the NBA this year is a true contender. IT'S WIDE FUCKING OPEN FOR THE LAKERS BAEBEEEEEEEE. LeBron and AD are STILL the best one two punch after Shaq and Kobe, and they finally have a DEEP team who can win an NBA game without not only BOTH LeBron and AD :BUT ALSO THEIR THIRD STAR.

It's post fucking all star break, and the team is winning without their best players. If you're talking shit, shut the fuck up and stop criticizing the team, you pedantic d bag. At this point, any micromanaging means jack SHIT and you're just a HATER, NOT A FAN. Apologize to Darvin Ham. Apologize to Rob Pelinka. Fuck you, LeBron, get your 38 year old ass together and DO SOMETHING THE WORLD HAS NEVER SEEN.

NEPHEWS. RAISE YOUR HANDS. SUPPORT THE FUCKING TEAM. BANNERS UP, EIGHT FUCKING TEEN BAY BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

TLDR: Stop complaining, nerd. Get on the bandwagon, we're taking off without you. This is a historic season. Let's win the ship.",1.0

[Lineup data vs Grizzlies \(2\/28\)](https://preview.redd.it/1r0m3zuvfdla1.png?width=924&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=aeb27f9853fb2fa973c149f21b370bc6b60dfbb2)

Some things to note:

Despite seemingly going crazy from 3, Reaves seemed to struggle last game, playing a role in our bottom 5 lineups. This may have something to do with his 4 turnovers on the night. He has really struggled in lineups where he is the primary ball handler.

Walker had himself a game, but seems to do better when he is on the floor with Schroder rather than Reaves. 

All in all, a lot of noise in this dataset, Grizzlies had an insane third quarter which definitely fucks up the numbers.

&amp;#x200B;

[Lineup data vs OKC \(3\/1\)](https://preview.redd.it/9kxc5uq4hdla1.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=5b3ff8e0949f752f402eac77248f371925450666)

Hachimura and Schroder seem to be our two standout players here, being part of our three best lineups.

However, Hachimura was also a part of our two worst lineups so idk. I thought he had a good game overall by the eye test. Seems the lineup with Reaves-Walker-Christie-Rui-Gabriel just doesn't seem talented enough. I know we were short handed last night but that's not an NBA lineup. I think Christie has potential but he is frankly too raw for us at this point.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

There wasn't that much content for these last two games, so I decided to run +/- data for our players over the last five games. 

&amp;#x200B;

[One-man plus\/minus data](https://preview.redd.it/hb72rtk3idla1.png?width=284&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=e7dd3a216c9b89d19fd5ee42582fc936fb7ccc70)

Some things to note:

Our starting five is stellar, all five within the top six.

The only exception? Schroder. He has been excellent in Russell's absence. I feel that Russell's absence does not hurt the starting lineup due to Schroder being so good, but rather the bench because we have no ball handler for that group.

Austin Reaves seems to have had a rough couple games. I think his role over the last few games is the culprit. When Reaves replaces Beasley in the pseudo-starting lineup (Schroder-Reaves-Bron-Vando-AD), we are virtually the same. I think the problem is when Reaves runs with the bench crew without Schroder or LeBron, and is forced to be the primary ball handler.

To add on to my previous point, all the bench guys with the exception of Brown, who plays a lot of minutes with the starters (and started a few games), is in the negatives. This is a result of LeBron and Russell being out of the lineup, forcing Dennis away from the bench group, leaving Reaves as your only ball handler.

&amp;#x200B;

[Two-man plus\/minus data \(top 5 and bottom 5\)](https://preview.redd.it/ntyj41ywjdla1.png?width=486&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=9e7bd3a54df105c88bc89974c4cba8d10e2f60e9)

Since there were too many two-man combinations, I decided to just display the top 5 and bottom 5. If you guys would like to see specific pairings, let me know and I will respond. I also limited my scope to just our top ten rotation players, as I feel like that is what Ham will play in the playoffs. 

Vanderbilt and Davis have been excellent together, locking shit up defensively.

LeBron and Schroder have such great chemistry. I made a post earlier today talking about their work together in the bench lineup.

Vando and Beasley got that triple trade connection so their chemistry is already through the roof. 

&amp;#x200B;

8219,2023-03-03 16:39:13,11h5928,The Scenario,platinumfinch,"The Lakers re-evaluate LeBron in mid-March and he is slated for a potential comeback in ‚Äúearly-to-mid April.‚Äù The team hobbles along and as April arrives, it is clear that it‚Äôs down to the Utah Jazz and the Lakers for the 10th slot.

The Lakers control their own destiny - needing to win most of their last 5 games to get in the play-in. The team figures it will rest LeBron against the Rockets on April 2nd, but in a disaster, the team loses to the Rockets, tightening the race with the Jazz.

The Lakers will need to win their last four and get at least two Jazz losses in order to make the play-in. Luckily for the Lakers, this means they still control their destiny, playing the Jazz twice in the final four games. Unfortunately for the Lakers, the Jazz‚Äôs other two games look to be a breeze; they have games against a rapidly tanking OKC squad and a resting Nuggets squad that has locked up the #1 seed. Meanwhile for the Lakers, their other two are against the scorching hot Clippers and sizzling Suns - both making late pushes for playoff positioning. There is no room for error.¬†¬†

In his return LeBron returns and hits the game-winner against the Jazz in Utah, hobbling off the court. Darvin Ham indicates in his press conference that he doubts LeBron can play. LeBron contradicts Ham, setting off a media firestorm, ‚ÄúIf Coach thinks I‚Äôm gonna rest for the LA faithful, then he really doesn‚Äôt know the first thing about me.‚Äù With AD, Vando, and Schroder sidelined for the second night of the back to back, all signs point to the Lakers packing up their season.

But LeBron plays on the second night of the back-to-back. Although it‚Äôs an ‚Äúaway‚Äù game, LeBron makes a big deal of showing up for the LA crowd. And he shows out - as the Clips send an endless array of wings at LeBron, he goes full beast mode like we‚Äôve almost never seen before. With 44 points, a career-high 21 rebounds, 12 assists, and 4 blocks, LeBron edges the Lakers past the Clips, securing the game-winning rebound with 4 seconds left and hitting one of two free throws to put the Lakers up by 4 to seal the game.

The Suns game comes down to the wire as well - after Durant sinks a three over LeBron and AD to put the Suns up 2 with 5.9 seconds left, LeBron gets a game winning ‚Äòand-1‚Äô with a ferocious dunk on Booker. It‚Äôs all down to the final game against the Jazz.

The Lakers build a big lead early, but then LeBron twists an ankle in the second quarter. Talen Horton-Tucker, the Jazz player closest to LeBron on the play, is booed vociferously by the crowd, but he comes out angry in the second half. Eschewing his point-guard duties, he plays like a man possessed, hitting 6 of 8 threes to put the Jazz up by one at the end of the third. AD shows up after he and LeBron get into it on the sideline, and his dominant 4th quarter puts the Lakers into the 10th seed.

The game is the most electric that New Orleans has seen since finishing the sweep against the Blazers in 2018. But while that crowd was excited, this crowd is much angrier - with a chip on their shoulder. An amazing game sees the Pels and Lakers go down to the wire, but D-Lo hits AD for an absolute dagger of an alleyoop over BI, with the foul shot putting the Lakers up 9 with less than two minutes to play.

Unfortunately for the Lakers, the T-Wolves upset the Clips after Kawhi was ejected for a double technical when Gobert punched him in an injured leg. While Gobert is suspended for the next two games, a Clips squad hungry for revenge ‚Äúhosts‚Äù the Lakers with revenge on their minds. Unfortunately for the Clips, the Lakers dominate with their size and length, going up by 31 with 8 minutes left in the fourth, and Coach Ham takes a timeout to sub LeBron and AD out of the game for the final time.

The Lakers reward is a gritty-7 gamer against the Nuggets. The Lakers go up 3-2 on Denver's home court, but LeBron and AD‚Äôs injuries mount up as the Lakers lose game 6 on their home floor in embarrassing fashion - a 41 point drubbing. AD locks up Jokic in game 7 as LeBron is hobbled once more, and the Lakers squeak past the Nuggets.

The second round sees the Lakers squared up with the 5th seeded Warriors fresh off an impressive 4-1 series win over the Grizz. The LeBron and Warriors rivalry is reborne, but the Warriors have no answer for AD, and the D-Lo revenge game in game 6 seals it for the Lakers - D-Lo goes 7 of 9 from three for 38 points, just enough to overcome Curry‚Äôs 9 of 12 effort.

The Lakers are into the Western conference finals. The Lakers are injured. They are gassed. They had to win two play-in games, upset the number one seed Nuggets and a Warriors dynasty. They‚Äôve played 15 games counting the play-in and playoffs.

Meanwhile, their opponent has played exactly 8 postseason games. Kevin Durant‚Äôs Suns have absolutely crushed opponents, with only one game decided by less than 15 points - it was a KD game-winner in a Game 3 on the Mavs‚Äô home court.

The epic 7-game clash sees incredible play from KD and LeBron. LBJ‚Äôs 3-point stroke returns just in time to match KD. While Vando holds KD in the low 30‚Äôs for most of the games, the Suns have no answer for the Lakers‚Äô bully-ball and KD is gassed after doing so much to defend LBJ, AD, and carrying the Suns‚Äô offense. After winning game 7 on Phoenix, LeBron tells Doris Burke he‚Äôs grateful to be heading to his 11th NBA finals, and feels that there is no doubt this is the hardest road he‚Äôs ever faced.

The Lakers bully-ball didn‚Äôt see an answer in the Western conference. But the Buck‚Äôs bully-ball absolutely dominated in the East. The Bucks are well-rested, having run through the Eastern conference with only a single loss to the Celtics. The Lakers once again seem gassed and must prepare for a quick turn-around, after having played 22 games in the same time that the Bucks have played 13.

The series is defined by the NBA‚Äôs newest meme: LeBron‚Äôs incredulous face at a presser before game 1 when Dave McMenamin accidentally insinuates that Giannis has been the best player in the league this season. McMenamin, seeing LeBron‚Äôs face, stumbles over his words trying to take it back. ‚ÄúNah, it‚Äôs cool Dave, he has been the best so far this season.‚Äù Lebron stands up from the podium and posts nothing else before game 1.

LeBron puts up 60 points in game 1 as the Lakers obliterate the Bucks. 55 in Game 2, another win, albeit closer. His 48 point performance in game 3 is just shy of Giannis‚Äô 49 - but it‚Äôs still enough to put the Lakers up 3-0. 42 points from Lebron in game 4 seals it. As he accepts his 5th NBA finals MVP, he thanks AD and Vando for locking up Giannis and D-Lo and Schroder for finding him in his spots all series.

In his answer to the final question on the podium, LeBron says ‚ÄúOh, sure, we‚Äôre all going‚Äô to Disneyland, but then I gotta see about some ghosts next season.‚Äù Shannon Sharpe rides in the Lakers victory parade, sandwiched between LeBron and AD in shorts and cozy-looking sweater.

The now LA-based sports guy Bill Simmons begrudgingly states that this may be the greatest championship win ever: Lebron beat Kawhi in the play-in, took out the #1 seed with three-time MVP Jokic, upset the dynastic warriors, and beat a finals contender with KD before dispatching Giannis in sweep while averaging 52 points in the finals. The only question Bill has is whether LeBron was better in 2013 when he was in his prime, 2016 when he upset the 73-win Warriors, or here a decade later in 2023, when LeBron took the toughest playoff road off all time, and won a chip as the 10th seed. 

Baseball is cancelled for the summer while sports stations just air talking heads debating the basketball goat.

Kyrie spends the summer in LA, but after his controversial remarks about the Lakers GM and owners, the Lakers opt to bring-on James Harden instead.

He stated his source has seen the scans, and is very close to the situation, and told Skip that the right ankle is ‚Äòan absolute mess‚Äô and if LeBron wants to play 2-3 more years then surgery to clean it up is going to be required at some point.

8259,2023-03-04 17:20:01,11i749m,Malik Beasley confuses me,SnooCauliflowers4732,He is buckets from three and I think he was a great pickup and I am not hating and like him alot. although something one thing I cant seem to understand is how when this dude misses a shot let me tell you he misses. I couldn't stop laughing at that 10 foot floater he had where he only hit like the top left side of the backboard last night. It just surprises me how such a good shooter either splashes it or either completely misses looking like a 4th grade b team kid who finally got his first chance to score a basket. seems like if he makes a shot its nothing but net but if he misses its just not even close.,1.0

Why do we want to have him on a long term contract?,Gristle__McThornbody,We already have one fragile player Anthony Davis. And unfortunately it's very likely Lebron starts missing more games in his career simply due to his age and body breaking down. Why do we want to give another big contract to a guy who is just as injured as our other two stars if not more? This is not winning Basketball. The best teams always stay relatively healthy. That played a role why we won the championship in the bubble. Lakers need to strongly explore other options. A Dlo signing should be our very last option.,1.0

8284,2023-03-05 09:42:39,11it3gi,We need to accept the reality of this season,Vegetable_Bank9063,"Scrolling through Lakers Reddit every day is wildly entertaining. Not only is our online fan base super bi-polar, but you also RARELY see realistic takes.

Here‚Äôs my realistic theory, that COULD be wrong, but is in the ballpark of our reality‚Ä¶

Lakers skid into the Play-in as the nine seed. Utah and NO continue to slide, and the Lakers scrape together a couple of wins to push in front of them. LeBron returns with 4-5 games left in the regular season to try and get into a rhythm. 

For the play-in, Zion has recently returned, so the Lakers play the Pels at home. Zion dominates, but Dlo has mismatches all game and uses them to feed AD and Bron all game. Lakers W.

Lakers then play Dallas in Dallas for the 8-seed. Luka gets gassed when it matters most, and the Lakers run away in the 4th. 

First round against the Nuggets, and everyone is predicting that the lakers will take the series since theyare such a dangerous 8-seed. But with the lack of experience since Lebron‚Äôs return, Jokic picks our defense apart and Ham makes no creditable lineup adjustments. Lakers get taken down in 6.

And this is OKAY. If our team gets 8 playoff games together I feel really good about our chances next year. I HOPE I‚Äôm wrong, but this is the most realistic outcome.

Not much to say, if were a serious team and want to make the play in, we literally can't lose this game.

Apart from that here is what we need today.

1. Suns(+1.5) OVER the Mavericks
2. Magic(-1.5) OVER the Trail Blazers
3. Thunder(-5.5) OVER the Jazz
4. Grizzlies(+6.5) OVER the Clippers

The goal is the championship‚Äù. He knows he can push and get 35 a night to carry this team to play ins but that wont solve anything. So he needs to sit out some winnable games and see if this team is worth the blood sweat and whatever remaining miles he‚Äôs got in him. I obv want him back and it‚Äôs just my guess. But i think if we perform well until Mar 24 then he‚Äôll come back with a reason else its next season.",1.0

In the last 6 quarters, GSW has:

3 face smacks / eye pokes delivered from Draymond Green and Klay Thompson.

1 insanely obvious inbounds attack on D'Lo courtesy of Divincenzo.

1 incredibly obtuse trip on LeBron from Poole at the three-point line--this one was so bad the nationalized broadcast rewound the tape solely to zoom in on Poole's foot in the midst of play.

That's FIVE dirty plays delivered from FOUR different players in SIX quarters.

Is anyone going to mention this bullshit to the league? These f\*cks should face fines.",1.0

8353,2023-03-06 04:49:40,11jorij,My evaluation of Rui Hachimura so far,denobino,"Things he's already decent at

\- Midrange \[Season average 49.6% 113 attempts\]  
\- Corner threes \[Season average 47.6% 42 attempts\]  
\- Can spread the floor from the midrange area \[especially elbow\] and corner.  
\- Decent hustle.  


Things he can work on  
\- Defensive consistency. (He will go on stretches of playing outstanding defense and all of the sudden not).  
\- Needs to work on his finishing. He is athletic but his moves are stiff in general. He has the body to be a better finisher at the rim.   
\- Lateral quickness can use some work. This will also help him to be a better defender.  
\- He needs to be more aggressive with the ball. His play style is really passive from what I've seen. He mostly relies on his footwork to get to the spot he wants. But he has an NBA-ready body that he's not using to its full potential. This goes for both ends of the floor.   
\- Be a better threat at the dunker spot.  


I am a big Rui fan and I want to see him succeed. I truly think he can be an outstanding role player on the Lakers going forward given the right guidance, training, and coaching. I don't think we've seen enough of him to come to conclusion about him just yet.",1.0

He looked like he really wanted to win and while im not completely saying that wasnt the case when he was with us, he often just wanted to control the game and take 'that' shot at the end. He differs to PG and leonard towards the end of the game and sits back meanwhile here you see him shooting random jumpshots and 3s at the end of the game with us

2-3 on the rooting guide last night( you could call it 3-2 if you want) so not the best results wise. Portland and Clippers somehow escaping with wins, the Jazz Thunder game was 50-50 so we take either way, gladly the Suns beat the Mavericks and the Celtics lose again.

Want to shoutout  u/deftspyder for posting the results in the thread as they come in.

Here is who you should be giving energy today.

1. Pistons(+6.5) OVER the Trailblazers.
2. Kings(-5.5) OVER the Pelicans.

8373,2023-03-06 22:37:00,11kgip2,Who can we realistically keep next season?,NonSpicySamosa,"I'm really liking this team we have right now. Next season we have LeBron, AD, Vanderbilt, Bamba, Beasley (Team Option), Reed, and Christie.

I'd like to keep Reaves, Beasley, Schroeder, Troy Brown, and Wenyen. 

Not much needs to be said about Reaves. He's becoming a great offensive asset and is definitely getting paid next season. I love Wenyen's hustle every game. Troy Brown is a great role player and pops off on 3's every once in a while. Schroeder's great too. But I'm sure he will also get a big raise next season. Beasley's a killer 3 pt shooter and has a 15 mill team option. Correct me if I'm wrong. I'm on the fence with Hachimura. I wouldn't be too sad if we don't re-sign him for another defensive player. So far D'lo has been looking great the few games he's played but he's probably looking for a lot of money next season. As for Lonnie, I think we can let him walk.

So, what do you think? With some of these players who might expect more money, who do you think we'd be able to keep?",1.0

[Five man lineup data vs Warriors \(3\/6\)](https://preview.redd.it/mjx8i93w47ma1.png?width=908&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=c91efe9af6416a7f736ac584aedead8e2385f0b9)

Some things I noticed:

Darvin Ham did something very interesting this game, subbing out Dennis for Reaves early in the first, letting Reaves run point guard with the rest of the starters. That lineup was excellent (+14).

Ham ran Schroder with the bench group instead, which struggled (-9). 

Also ironic that our three(four if you count brown he's only 6 6) guard lineup was actually positive on the night lol (+5). 

&amp;#x200B;

Some more thoughts on Austin Reaves:

I recently wrote about how frustrated I was with Ham playing Reaves as the primary ball handler, expressing that he is a shooting guard. The very next game, Ham plays Reaves as the point guard with the starters and the offense looked really good lol. Instead, Dennis ran with the bench group and struggled. 

This is something I noted when I analyzed the +/- data of all players throughout the last 6 games, as Austin Reaves had the lowest +/- of any Lakers player. I said then that I thought this stat did not reflect Reaves' play, as he spent most of his minutes with the less talented bench group, and therefore had lower +/- numbers. Dennis, on the other hand, ran with the bench group this game and saw a hit to his +/-. 

I still think Reaves struggles defensively as a point guard, getting cooked by Curry while Dennis was on the bench. I preferred when he guarded Klay, as we saw the last time we played the Warriors. 

In conclusion, I underestimated Reaves playmaking ability, but I think he still has defensive struggles against quicker guards.",1.0

Obviously, we were fucked with injuries at the start of the season.

Nash got hurt in Game 2 of the season, Dwight not healthy enough, Pau missed weeks IIRC with plantar fasciitis and Kobe just killed and willed the team by himself. 

I remember we were 17-25 at one point in Memphis and I think they had a team meeting or players only meeting after that. We finished 28-12 after that. It was a good turning point, but a little bit too late.

I just hope we had some of the bench guys (YOUTH!!!!!!!) from 2013-2014 to that cursed season. Farmar, Xavier Henry, Wes Johnson would have been solid bench players IF WE had them the year we had Dwight. 

We had no bench presence that year. I think Jamison was the only solid one and he was washed that time. Chris Duhon was soooooo trash.

The standings right now looks crazy with Jazz, Blazers, Lakers and Pelicans all sitting with identical 31-34 records. That all can change after tonight's games and if all goes our way we can be up to the 9th seed by the end of the day.

The entire game the refs have been hesitant to call fouls on the grizzlies. Like when Schroeder got tangled up with Jackson it took so long for the ref to finally HAVE to call a foul. This has been happening in spurts all year. The lakers are a popular team and draw the majority of bets. The refs favor the other team because of this. Not that I think anything can be done. There‚Äôs millions of dollars made by the fixing and it won‚Äôt ever stop. Just venting,1.0

AD with a monster 30-22 game to push the team into the 9th seed and a playin spot, that is what you need from your stars when you're playing must win games, and AD showed again why when healthy and in rhythm he's top 5. 

The Lakers are 7-3 since the trade deadline, #1 in defence in that time. This is with missing Bron and D'Lo for almost all of these 10 games. Just incredible momentum to build off on in the coming days.

2-1 on yesterday's rooting guide with the 76ers beating the Timberwolves and the Mavericks taking care of the Jazz, the loss was from the Thunder getting a win vs the Warriors but i guess that helps us anyway so we take it kind of. 

For today it's a 4 game guide as we hope for the Lakers to get some help to move up into the 5th/6th seed region.

**Rooting Guide.**

1. **Pelicans(+1.5)** over the Mavericks
2. **Celtics(-10.5)** over the TrailBlazers
3. **Suns(-13.5)** over the Thunder
4. **Raptors(+3.5)** over the Clippers

Mavericks helped us yesterday but today is the day they have to lose, also i know it feels icky to root for the celtics, just don't watch the game and check to score at the end of the night. 

2 days off for the team now, D'Lo back on Friday. Job's not finished. 

GO LAKERS!!!

[Five man lineups vs the Grizzlies \(3\/7\)](https://preview.redd.it/64ups6oqpjma1.png?width=910&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=5dc3344b46e31f0a4b9062d685f5158cf4e9c952)

Some things I noticed:

That closing group was a +25 on the night. I had to double and triple check my code to make sure that wasn't an error. Everything just seemed to be clicking for the Lakers with that lineup. Rui was hitting his midrange shot which helps space the floor, Troy and Reaves were lights out from downtown, just beautiful basketball. 

Our worst lineup occurred when Ham decided to go small ball with Vando at the five. While I understand we have a lack of depth at center with Bamba out, it was rough to see. Gabriel was not much better, playing a role in our other four worst lineups, ending with -15 on the night. I think this sub heavily overrates Gabriel because he was such a bright spot during those dark Westbrook days, but I don't think he warrants a spot in the rotation when everyone is healthy.

Non-lineup related, but I wanted to talk about the phenomenal job Schroder did on Bane. I was checking my phone at halftime to see if something happened to Bane because I barely noticed him in the entire first half. Bane only scored his 3/14 field goals during a stretch in the third or fourth quarter when Schroder was on the bench and he drove past Reaves for some easy layups. I don't recall him scoring, or making any sort of play while Schroder was on the court. Absolutely locked down.

Speaking of Reaves, he wasn't bad defensively by any stretch of the imagination. Bane may be too quick for Austin, which is why he shouldn't be guarding him in the first place, but Reaves did some excellent work on Dillon Brooks. 

&amp;#x200B;

The depth and versatility of this roster is truly something to behold when fully healthy. Assuming LeBron and AD are healthy, our closing lineup \*should\* consist of those two, a forward, and two guards. If our opponent is someone like Dallas or Phoenix, we can throw Vanderbilt at their best player to harass and pester them all night. If not, we have Rui who has a beautiful midrange game and can hit the three occasionally. For the remaining two guards, we have D'Angelo Russell, Malik Beasley, Dennis Schroder, and Austin Reaves. Each of which provide unique qualities either offensively or defensively. This is all without mentioning Troy Brown Jr, who could slot either as a SG or SF. He has been hitting 44% from 3 since the all star break, along with playing crucial defense. Truly so much to be optimistic about. We are 7-3 since the trade, 3-0 with LeBron, 3-1 with Dlo.",1.0

1) Rui Hachimura does not get the recognition he deserves imo. 

2) Dennis Schr√∂der is honestly so good. His stats might look ass on paper but when you watch him, he hits some really big shots ngl

3) AD needs to be dominant like he has been, but I often see him (often meaning relatively, more than I‚Äôd like to see) be a little passive, maybe that‚Äôs for the best because we don‚Äôt want another injury, idk, maybe I‚Äôm wrong?

4) The shooters were horrible yesterday but I don‚Äôt wanna grill them, instead, I‚Äôd hope that the coaching staff would recognize weaknesses and make adjustments.

6) I love the defense, it‚Äôs been great for the most part but sometimes I can‚Äôt stand to see opposing players just jog by and make a layup (especially happened vs warriors and yesterday too)

5) I have no idea when Bron will be back but this code is amazing. AR and Vanderbilt is amazingly consistent, I have no complaints. 

6) Beasley was ass yesterday but I have high hopes, just one bad game,

Let‚Äôs fucking go. We missed an opportunity against the Wolves but I honestly think AD is unstoppable against most teams bc of his dominance and skills. We can win against Raptors, Knicks, Pelicans, Rockets, Mavs, and Magic.",1.0

1. D‚ÄôAngelo Russell (still needs to prove he‚Äôs worth 31m, but could be that third star).

2. Rui Hachimura (Young stud for cheap $6m???, he‚Äôs our Kyle Kuzma 2.0 Three level scorer, hard to find elite YOUNG scoring wings). 

3. Jarred Vanderbilt (Defense is god tier, only paid $4m could get a pay bump, if he learns a 3 pointer could become a defensive anchor).

4. Austin Reaves (He‚Äôs cheap but he‚Äôs so impactful for $2m, he makes 2-3 incredible defensive plays a night and can lock up some stars, second highest defensive rating on out team besides AD also has that bag on offense).

5. Troy Brown Jr (This could be controversial but I love his game he‚Äôs a $2m PERFECT 3-D player, if he plays against under guards his size is a problem on defense, give a slight pay bump but don‚Äôt sell the farm for him).

6. Dennis Schroder (Great guard who‚Äôs really clutch but some games he disappears, Best value player on our team for $2m but I fear we won‚Äôt be able to afford him if his value goes up).

7. Malik Beasley (he‚Äôs the shooter shooter we desperately needed but I‚Äôm concerned about his shot selection, I don‚Äôt know if he fits our team, where‚Äôs the defense? Also $16m?? We could easily better allocate that keeping other players or signing someone else).

8. Mo Bamba (I love Mo Bamba, I love his length shooting and want to keep him on our roster so bad but it‚Äôs hard to justify $10m for an injured prone backup center).

9. Lonnie Walker (This one is tough, but Lonnie is just a better THT, an undersized forward that has a better jumpshot. It just seems he‚Äôs out there trying to get his. I almost never see a Lonnie defensive highlight, buried on our roster for $6.5m that could be used on some guys on the top).

10. Wenyan Gabriel (Acceptable center for $2m, athletic can play defense but can feel lost at times, if we can‚Äôt keep Bamba resign him especially if AD might be injured for center depth but he‚Äôs a replaceable talent).

But to do what he did this trade deadline is nothing short of phenomenal.  

He turned the worst contract in all of sports into DLo, Malik Beasley, Jared Vanderbilt, and Rui Hachimura, basically overnight...  How is that even possible?  

That group is among the league's best of 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th best players, respectively, on any given team.  DLo mimmicks KD or Reggie Miller at times.  Beasley is always a 20 pt threat.  Vando is(was) one of the league's best kept secrets(elite efficiency).  And Hachimura is probably better than any team's 6th or 7th best player.  

This team's supporting cast is actually better than 2020's champion Lakers, imo.  

They have 5 guys that can drop 20 points on any night.  Has that ever even happened, ever?

There are so many variables running through my head but at the end of the day, I truly think we can run through the west with a tough battle vs any team in the east this year and next (sans a couple movable pieces‚Ä¶. Are we finals bound?  

Either way, it is imperative that we retain Austin Reaves. If they flub his free agency, I will pitch a bitch!!!",1.0

Hearing him and MacDonald‚Äôs back and forth on Thaddeus Young ‚Äúbeing around since the dawn of man‚Äù was one of many hilarious moments. I assume most of this sub is younger than me (I‚Äôm in my 30‚Äôs) so Stu and Chick Hearn were the first voices of Lakers basketball I ever knew. My dad, who I lost in May, was also a diehard Stu/Chick fan and if they weren‚Äôt on the call for a game we‚Äôd mute the TV and play them on the radio while watching. 

Being that Stu is now 76 years old, I get very sentimental knowing that there will be a large portion of my life where that man isn‚Äôt calling Laker games. He‚Äôs not only objective when he calls games and how he discusses officials‚Äô decisions, but he just adds so much to every telecast. 

Just making sure we all appreciate him while he‚Äôs here. 

He personifies greatness in his profession and will undoubtedly have a jersey next to Chick‚Äôs in the rafters. Long live Stu!",1.0

But I'm so happy with our recent wins that I at least want to entertain the question:

Right now, 

6 seed = Memphis or Sacramento round 1, unsure what team round 2

5 seed = Phoenix round 1, likely Denver round 2

Obviously things can shift but that feels pretty likely. IMO 6 seed is an easier route. Never been big on intentionally losing or resting players for positioning and we can match up with anyone. But I would rather have Phoenix and Denver exhaust each other if it plays out that way organically.",1.0

We couldn't come to a consensus, and I'm interested in hearing more opinions. It came up because I recently built an NBA Simulator that uses stats to simulate NBA teams playing each other, and the simulator had the 1979 team winning majority of the time.

If you had to choose, which team do you think would win in a head-to-head matchup, and why?

Personally, I believe the 1979 Lakers team would come out on top. While the 1972 team was stacked with talent, including Jerry West, Wilt Chamberlain, and Gail Goodrich, the 1979 team had a more balanced roster and a more modern style of play.

The 1979 Lakers had Magic Johnson, who was a rookie at the time, but already making a huge impact on the game. They also had Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who was still dominant, and a solid supporting cast that included Jamaal Wilkes, Norm Nixon, and Michael Cooper.

Overall, I think the 1979 Lakers would win in a close game due to their more modern style of play and well-rounded roster, in which the simulator I built justifies.

If you're interested in a more in-depth analysis on the simulator outcome, where 1979 Lakers would come out on top, check out the full write up I did (that my friends don't believe is realistic) \[[https://statsurge.substack.com/p/time-traveling-matchup-simulating](https://statsurge.substack.com/p/time-traveling-matchup-simulating)\]

Lakers take care of business at home vs the Raptors for the first time in forever. D‚ÄôLo, Dennis, Austin , Rui and Vando all with incredible games.

We won a game where AD had 8 (EIGHT!!!) points on 7 shots, and we looked good doing it. 8-3 since the trade deadline and the team chemistry vibes are immaculate.

To add to that a 2-0 record on the rooting guide with not 1 but 2 double digits comeback wins. The 76ers beat the Trailblazers with an Embiid game winner and the Nets beat the Timberwolves in OT.

Lakers now 1 game behind the #6 seed with momentum. Job‚Äôs not finished tho and here is who we root for today on a 4 game slate

**Rooting guide.**

1. **Knicks(+5.5)** over the Clippers
2. **Hornets(-2.5)** over the Jazz
3. **Grizzlies(-1.5)** over the Mavericks
4. **Thunder(+2.5)** over the Pelicans

Imagine going against the suns first üî• DLo vs Book , Ad vs Kd , Lebron vs Chris Paul. If that happens no one will stop kd and no one will stop Davis , so that‚Äôs even overall. But lakers in 6 or 7. If they face the clippers . Lebron vs Ad and DLo vs Pg . They really don‚Äôt got anyone stopping Davis. Either way Jarred Vanderbilt/ Rui is gonna shut down kawhi and PG. they will lock them down . And Russ is gonna be left wide open ! Clippers is easy series . Even with healthy PG and Kawhi they still getting lockdown ! Other team like Grizzles, Nuggets , and kings would be easy game for the lakers . Except warriors , since they are playing poorly due to injuries I don‚Äôt see them winning . If lakers go to the finals, it either gonna be Celtics or Bucks. If it‚Äôs Celtics , I have lakers winning in 6 . We have seen how bigger wings can contest Tatum and since we are first in defense, we have a chance to shut down Tatum . By switching jarred and Rui on Tatum . We can also put Troy,jarred and Rui on brown. On the other hand if this was the buck in the finals it would be a close one. 50/50 both sides. If healthy and aggressive ad is playing then they might get a shot. The bench , DLo and bron must all play good defensively and offensively shooting the basketball. End of analysis!

- Reaves has been great from beyond the arc. He doesn't really take pull up shots or off the dribble but when he is open he has been hitting them.

- I'm especially pleased with TBJ he takes good quality shots and provides good defense. He is the wing we all been clamoring for and I really hope he keeps this up and we re-sign him. He is only 23!!

- I understand why Beasley has been mediocre for us. We been asking him to take tough shots. But I'm also disappointed how we don't look to run some plays as we have a Klay caliber player. I'm hoping with Dlo and Lebron can find him when he is open.",1.0

Gordon has more experience, but is also much older. Beasley can be streaky, but is also much younger which bodes better long term. Gordon can pull from very very deep, and stretching the floor that deep for guys like Bron and AD is a big plus in my book.

So not signing a big, at least on a 10-day contract was incredibly moronic. The big doesn't have to be a good defender. Just any sort of size as a deterrent and a rebounder would have ensured Lakers won the game. I don't know if it was hubris or that they were trying to save money, whatever it was, just not acceptable. Especially when you consider how tight it is in playoffs race.",1.0

Instead of putting a minutes restriction on AD, they flat out took him from this game (which is one that would have helped us tremendously in the standings).

I‚Äôm not mad at him since he was not allowed to play due to the medical staff, but the fo should have already signed a big to a 10 to cover the gap since bamba has been injured.

Nevertheless, it‚Äôs the worst team in the nba and we shouldn‚Äôt have needed AD to play like I‚Äôm seeing on this sub people complaining about. This team is good enough to compete with anybody and if we had a half decent big it would have been a lot better.

8991,2023-03-16 02:58:32,11si7nu,Our drop coverage is so weird and it's so ass,alozz,"I first noticed the weirdness of our defensive scheme when AD kept getting defensive 3 second calls, like 2 times a game at least, especially in pick&amp;roll scenarios and right after. 

The Lakers set their center so far away from the screen setter, like no matter who the ball handler is. 

Drop coverage is NOTHING NEW. It can work well against players who are not good shooters. But the Lakers over-do this to a tragic extend. Even the players who aren't shooters can easily pick up steam, cut-off angles and score against one of the best shot blockers in the NBA, because they have SO MUCH space to work with.

Our big (usually AD), doesn't even pretend to bother ball handlers until they are all the way to the rim. I am not blaming AD, this is a clear coaching decision.  

This was why Ja Morant had like a 30 point quarter a few games ago and even RJ Barrett cooked the Lakers defense. 

Also, the ballside defender on the wing sets himself as a secondary defender, which is also weird for the defender covering the first passing option. This allows the opponents to blow by defenders easily with one or two passes and Lakers always being in chase mode. 

The chase mode also affects our rebounding, messing up matchups and Lakers defense losing players crashing the board. 

Today's Rockets game wasn't anything new, Rockets frontcourt is not especially gifted ball handlers or smartest basketball players. But they are athletic and our drop coverage is so shitty, they were able to blow by constantly and get lay-ups and dunks. 

To the people blaming only the front office for today's loss, while yes, we needed another big, it doesn't excuse Ham's assness as a coach. We have the same problems we've had today when AD is playing, but it is just so much more obvious when he is not. 

I actually really like the squad we have right now, but I don't see us having any kind of success in the playoffs even if we make it with Ham. We have so many problems just with basic man-to-man and I didn't even cover our absolute joke of a zone and our offensive scheme (waste time &amp; play one on one).

I know analysis isn't really that common in the sub and most people won't read it but I wanted to get thoughts of a few people who did and basically release a bit of my anger.",1.0

&amp;#x200B;

We're 1 game away from the 7th seed, and 2 from the 6th seed. The Warriors also play TWolves and Mavs once,(Win, Win) while we also play the Mavs and Twolves once. Season is far from over and I expect us to bounce back from this loss.

&amp;#x200B;

The Wolves have a pretty nasty schedule too, ngl, don't think they'll hold that 7th seed for long. Assuming we beat the Mavs Friday (game of the year) I don't think they'll keep up with us after that.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point since they beat the warriors, I'm fine for rooting the clippers to win against other west teams ahead of us (hopefully they'll take care of the thunder and pels since they play them twice each). Let them take the 5 seed and play the suns. Who cares we only want 6-8.

&amp;#x200B;

I honestly think worst- ""realistic"" case scenario is we get the 7th seed and we play the Mavs/Twolves in the play-in  with hopefully a healthy LBJ and AD and smack them to play the grizz in the first round (I doubt they'll even have Adams back by then his knees are dust).",1.0

As long as we stay in 7th or 8th seed spot. We should be in good position to make the playoff, then we have to roll the dice with Denver or sac Kings. Both are great teams but as long as we are healthy and winning, I 'll take our chances up against anybody",1.0

I asked Chat GPT to write a poem about the challenges of being a lakers fan:

As a Lakers fan, I've seen the highs,
The championships, the glorious prize,
But with the triumphs come the lows,
The struggles, the setbacks, the crushing blows.

We've had our share of superstar names,
Kobe, Magic, Shaq, and James,
But even legends can't guarantee,
A victory, a title, a dynasty.

We've faced injuries, trades, and drama,
Lost games, missed shots, and even karma,
But still we cheer, we never waver,
Our loyalty to the purple and gold, we savor.

We know that being a Lakers fan,
Is not an easy path to take a stand,
But through it all, we stand proud and true,
United in our love for the team, our crew.

So bring on the challenges, the ups and downs,
We'll weather the storms, and wear the crowns,

For being a Lakers fan is not just a choice,
It's a badge of honor, a voice.",1.0

30 minutes to myself to cry, cuss and post shit on Reddit and rant... 

And the whole time I waited for you to respond. (My dad) 

And now, I'm calm for the most part, yet still steaming internally, stressed, aged, but tempered, knowing the season isn't over, hanging onto a thread of hope that we even make the playoffs. 

But in reality, we aren't winning shit this year. We can't even make it to 40 wins before 20 losses. This front office is the definition of incompetence. One good move to 3 bad ones. 

Dlo is good but not the answer. 

I'm closer and closer to accepting the reality that we wasted another year of LeBrons career. 

The reports earlier this week were that we were completely uninterested in chasing Kyrie this off season now that we have Dlo... 

Im of the opinion that that is a huge mistake and that if we don't sign Kyrie this off-season, Lebron's Lakers tenure will officially be a stain on his legacy. 2020 Title or not. Im giving Jeanie and Rob till next season to put a winning team around Lebron to truly compete, from the start of the season. No 2/10 start. I want 40 wins before 20 losses or her bitch ass needs to sell the team or let her younger brother take over. At least he can scout players and draft really well. 

And if by chance we do go anything close to 2/6 next season to start, FIRE DARWIN SHAM IMMEDIATELY!!!

I think when LeBron gets back, at least Dlo and Dennis won‚Äôt be asked to do too much. Dennis is another guy I‚Äôm not a huge fan of. He had a good game today but also just not consistent enough. 

I‚Äôm overall happy with the team despite the loss. We missed too many free throws. I guess it‚Äôs more likely now we will be fighting for a playoff spot in the play in games. But if we are fully healthy, I back our team to come out.

I liked this duo alot especially for replacement of Vando when he is struggling to guard centers. Vando's specialty is wing defender, so no using vando if opponent is attacking the paint. Also they are getting so many offensive rebounds from Gabriel too.

Players did not meet the expectation. Reaves as usual, been our momentum changer today but still missed unnecessary amount of free throws. DLo was chucking some wild threes when we were up, and Beasley did not make one three. AD, who should win the LVP for last game, made terrible defensive mistakes, missing freethrows to cover up his mistake and failed to guard Klebar at the end.

I dont like Ham as our coach but at least he showed improvement and actually did well on changing the lineup in 4th quarter.",1.0

9151,2023-03-18 14:33:40,11uq29s,The Fanbase,-Phoebus-,"Okay, today‚Äôs loss was devastating and its repercussions are severe, no doubt about that. It was heartbreaking to lose a winnable game at the last moment. 

But the reaction to this unforeseen loss in this sub was horrendous. I know the past cannot be a justification for the actions of the present, but to treat your star players in such a way is what makes this fanbase insufferable. 

I know the Lakers is a storied franchise with tons of legends playing under its banner, and the fans have high expectations from it. Hell, they've won 17 championships. Excellence in performance is expected from its players. 

However its no secret that the years after 2010, especially after Kobe's retirement were mediocre. We suffered the largest playoff drought in our history, with our respect going down every single year. Those were some dark times. However in 2020, we saw a beacon of hope. Our first championship in a decade, restoring the former glory of this historical franchise. This was led by Lebron and AD. We were finally pulled from the slumps and entered the highly competitive race again. 

I do not intend to defend AD's performance today. He did make mistakes and should be held accountable, no doubt. But to send death threats, to humiliate him to such an extent and to blame him for his injuries is simply unnacceptable, by human standards. At the end of the day, it's a game, where people either win or lose. Sometimes the luck favours the other side even though we desperately desire it and that's completely fine. Mistakes were made and we lost, get over it.

I love this fanbase when we win. I have not been a very seasoned follower of this franchise but have been following it for sometime now, especially this subreddit. And I love the passion and zeal with which we celebrate our players, not only the star ones but also the role players, giving them their flowers for an instrumental performance. However, when we lose, we act out and turn into the worst fanbase of the league, criticisng the very players who delivered us the tough fought wins earlier. AD had to deactivate his social media accounts, due to the negativity pouring in. He has been under constant pressure to perform extremely well and he has delivered most of the times, but we are fucking with his mental state. Same goes with the other players.Yes, he may be a super max player or is getting alot of money for playing here, but does that excuse us to be crast? An athlete does not have an MVP-esque performance every single game. They have their off days too. Even MJ had his own off days, so AD messing it up once is okay I guess.

Again, I am not a very seasoned follower of this franchise, or maybe it's not my place to say all this, But after today, this is what I felt and I thought I should share it. I love the Lakers and it's rich history, ranging from Mikan, West from the early 50s and 60s to Magic, Shaq, Kobe and Bron. But if we continue this culture, we'll make this franchise an anti-star one, where no one wants to come due to the high pressure. That's what I believe and its completely fine if some of you disagree.

Would be great if some of y'all shared your views as well!

Cheers! Onto the next game!",1.0

Obviously we already know what happened last night with AD committing a boneheaded foul on Kleber. Do what Stu says and contest to Kleber's right, away from his body and towards his shooting hand. Or just go full Luke Kornet. This is basic stuff.

But the org/FO has this issue too. Pelinka has made some really great trades but this FO just does really headscratching stuff nobody else would do. Not signing a big when you know Bamba is out and AD is going to sit as planned against Houston...why take an unnecessary risk? Why not go the safe route that has basically zero downsides? Even with the great trade deadline, Pelinka still deserves blame for not making the moves earlier. Now, maybe a trade for Dlo/Beasley/Vando didn't materialize until right then, but once again we basically sacrifice another season or leave ourselves with zero margin of error to save the season. And we know that with Lebron out this team does not have the bball IQ to not have a margin of error. 

And ofc, there's the Caruso disaster. I don't think anybody in the league expected us to NOT resign him, including Caruso himself. Yet we take a gamble on THT instead of going the safe route that would've paid off more with Caruso.

Timberwolves, Clippers and Warriors all lost last night. The jazz won and the Lakers are now 11th out of the play in spots.

**Rooting Guide.**

1. **Suns(+1.5)** over the Thunder
2. **Rockets(+5.5)** over the Pelicans
3. **Trailblazers(+3.5)** over the Clippers

If Lakers lose today the rooting guide ends. What motivated me to start this was the prospect of Lakers getting up to the 6th seed, i really don't care if they make only the play in.

We have definitely been worse in 2014-2018 but the expectations weren't there since Kobe was hurt and we could watch the kids develop. For 2005-2007, it was a treat to watch Kobe go off, but once again little expectations to compete for a title without a 2nd allstar.

Beasley does none of that while being an even worse shooter than Danny Green was here in 2020. Reaves on the other hand, not only is a much more consistent offensive talent, but already a near elite defensive guard according to advanced statistics (as well as eye test the majority of times).

Los Angeles Lakers Sign LeBron James and Anthony Davis to Join Star Player Austin Reaves

Los Angeles, CA - The Los Angeles Lakers have just announced the signing of two of the NBA's most talented players, LeBron James and Anthony Davis, to join their star player Austin Reaves, who just achieved a career-high 35 points in a game.

The signing of James and Davis represents a significant boost to the Lakers' already formidable roster, as they seek to reclaim the NBA championship. James, widely regarded as one of the greatest basketball players of all time, brings with him a wealth of experience and a winning mentality that will undoubtedly inspire his teammates.

Davis, a six-time NBA All-Star and former Defensive Player of the Year, is a dominant force on both ends of the court and will add significant depth to the Lakers' frontcourt.

Joining forces with these two superstar players is Austin Reaves, who has already demonstrated his immense potential with his recent career-high performance. With James and Davis on board, Reaves will have the opportunity to learn from two of the best in the game and further develop his skills.

Speaking about the signing, Lakers General Manager Rob Pelinka said, ""We are thrilled to welcome LeBron and Anthony to the Lakers family, and we know they will be great additions to our team. With Austin already showing his talent, we believe we have a strong foundation to build on as we look to bring another championship to Los Angeles.""

The Lakers' fans will undoubtedly be excited to see this new-look team in action, and the upcoming NBA season promises to be one of the most anticipated in recent memory.

Now anytime Reaves is mentioned on Reddit or in a game, she jokes that she was his first fan and discovered him. After his career night and talks about him getting paid in his next contract, she joked that she‚Äôd follow him anywhere he goes in the NBA.

I guess this is a pointless story, but I find it really funny that my girlfriend who knows a small amount about basketball made one joke about the lakers new young player who ended up being the crowd favorite and a big part of this Laker roster.

Props to the bench cause of Rui with his midrange magic, Dennis enjoying scoring off the bench like he used to, Wenyen with all the energy in the world and AR wuth everything he have. 

I think AR should start now cause next game is against Booker and Beasley is trash right now especially with Bron out. Still think Bron can get him out of this slump but we dont have Bron right now so starting AR might be a better choice than waiting for Beasley to shoot 5 threes and make none.

He has one good game draining 6-7 threes and follows that up with 5-6 games of being complete garbage.

It doesn‚Äôt even have to do with LA‚Äôs pressure: dude is shooting less than 38% from 3 for his career. What true sniper is below 38% over their CAREER?

The eye test shows he is an okay shooter at best: he misses wide open shots badly and holds his follow through all the time

A real shooter is someone like Buddy Hield or Bojan. Those guys make their shots no matter if wide open or even triple teamed at times. Pelinka really should have tried harder to get one of those guys (not taking any shots at him btw).

9451,2023-03-23 15:29:17,11znu2t,The Vanderbilt Dilemma,Chao_607,"Anthony Davis and Devin Booker struggled in the first half yesterday before going off in the third quarter. 

AD in the first half: 7 pts on 3/6 FG.

Booker in the first half: 8 pts on 3/6 FG.

AD in the third quarter: 14 pts on 6/10 FG.

Booker in the third quarter: 14 pts on 5/6 FG. 

What happened in the third quarter? With 6 minutes left in the third quarter, Vando picked up his fourth foul, and was subbed in place of Beasley. In the six minutes Vando was playing, AD was 2/4 from the field, scoring 4 more points. Booker only shot the ball once. After Vando went to the bench, AD would go 4/6 dropping 10 points in 6 minutes, and Booker would go 4/5 dropping 9 points in those 6 minutes. This is the Vanderbilt dilemma. He is one of the best defenders in the NBA, the stats and eye test both show that he had Booker in jail for the first half. Unfortunately, he also does not space the floor, leading to the Suns doubling AD, causing him to struggle offensively. 

Vanderbilt's offensive struggles are not due to a lack of effort. He went 5/5 from the field and 3/3 from the free throw line last night, which is a huge part of why we won. However, teams will bet that he won't maintain this consistency and continue to clog the paint, causing future problems for AD, and the reason for rough week.

Personally, my basketball philosophy tends to favor defense over offense, so I wouldn't advocate dropping Vando out of the starting lineup or limiting his minutes. We actually lost the third quarter by 4 points (partially due to Wenyen's six point swing), as AD's offensive explosion was mostly nullified by Booker's offensive explosion. I think/hope that LeBron's return will solve this dilemma, as Vanderbilt is a really good cutter, which LeBron will exploit with his cutting.

I am sure plenty of stans will pick LeBron and thats fine, hard to argue with arguably the best or 2nd best player ever. And when AD is physically and mentally sound, he is a top 5 player in the league, if not top 2 or 3.

But for me, I love DLo and Reaves. Both play hard and play well. Sure some deficiencies, off-shooting nights, defensive issues, whatever, but I always root for guys who play hard night in and night out and maybe arent the superstar everyone is expecting and paying to see.

Glad to have DLo back, he is mature, and perfect for us. and Reaves is playing out of his mind, I love to see it.

1) Suns: are 2.5 games ahead of us and have a 2-1 lead in h2h but if we win the match later on we'll be tied and it'll depend on conference. Suns are 24-19 and we are 21-24. So unlikely but its possible.

Darvin Ham is cool under fire. It is incredibly refreshing to see a coach who isn‚Äôt a hot headed lunatic. You never see him berating his guys or flying off the handle yelling at the officials. I really think there is something to be said about a coach who offers that level of poise, which I think has rubbed off on the team.

TBJ still hitting big 3s for the Lakers but has cooled of a little bit in recent games. He still played good defense as him and Vando take turns in defending wings. 

Schr√∂der has been a starting calliber back up pg for the lakers, has been clutch in the 4th and always hustles and plays hard on defense. Almost every time he starts he turns up. His chemistry within this team has been great even in his first stint while having good relationship with Ham. 

Both of them likely to get paid next offseason who would you re-sign?? 

Max Christie has played good early in the season. Shoot well from 3, plays good defense while being extremely young. Can he be the back up wing if Rob decided to bring back Dennis or should they let Austin Reeves be the back up pg next year and resign TBJ instead?",1.0

Lakers take on the Chicago Bulls today in another game towards the push for the 6th seed. AD needs to be dominant again and hopefully D'Lo is ready to go. ""Miraculously"" DeRozan is healthy to play for them and you know Pat Bev is going to be hyped up so need the team to come with the needed energy and focus.

A 2-1 day on last night's rooting guide, the Kings take care of business again for us as they've done multiple times this season beating the Jazz and the Pelicans beat the Clippers which on one had moves them tied with us but on the other hand moves the Clippers closer to being within reach for the 6th spot. Lastly the Suns beat the 76ers without Harden.

A 3 game rooting guide today so here it is.

**Rooting Guide.**

1. **Hornets(+10.5)** over the Mavericks
2. **Trail Blazers(+8.5)** over the Thunder
3. **Warriors(-6.5)** over the Timberwolves

None of this is important if the Lakers take a step back today, so take care of business and watch as other things unfold.

GO LAKERS!!!

9728,2023-03-26 22:29:55,12323n8,Key Takeaways from the Lakers vs Bulls Game:,ILoveMasterYi,"Positives:

\- Lebron James returned and looked like he was moving well and could get to the rim

\- When Lebron was on the floor the offense looked very good, Malik got better looks and he was setting everyone up

\- Lost by only 10 despite being just torched defensively, with some adjustments the game on Wednesday should be much more competitive

\- Our defense was able to keep them under 60 points in the 2nd-Half, almost everything that could have gone right for the Bulls went right and everything that could have gone wrong went wrong for the Lakers at times. 

&amp;#x200B;

Negatives:

\- Rotations: we ran multiple small lineups that forced AD to contest a lot of tough layups and it hurt us when he was in foul trouble

\- Defense: Transition defense was just poor, they had way too many easy looks and straight line dunks coming in the transition. 

\- Quality of Looks: We should been focused on attacking the Bulls paint, especially when Drummond was on the floor and had 3 fouls in the 3rd, instead we settled a lot. 

&amp;#x200B;

These games happen, we have won 3 of our last 4 and every team loses but these mistakes are very fixable and the Lakers will look to get the win on Wednesday. Love the LakeShow and make sure you enjoy the rest of your weekend (its just a game, don't ruin your time &lt;3)",1.0

For example (Dennis runs the shot clock down to 8 sec) then throws the ball to AD with only 8 seconds left. Our guards to give AD the ball when he far away from the basket. 2019/2020 and 2020/2021 our guards would feed him the ball when he was at least 12 feet from the basketball not from the three point line and expect him to work from there.

Proceeds to put in Jared Vanderbilt who can't shoot. And Gabriel who can't shoot either. Rui could of easily scored enough points in the minutes Gaberial, Vanderbilt, and Walker had, and won us the game.

Sorry but its what everyone is thinking.

The only other explanation is that if he breaks out they can't keep him for a cheap contract. Which was sort of the reason why the Wizards iced him and traded him. Essentially they are clearly cutting his minutes to cut his contract or harm is career. It's a bad look on the organization. Let him play. Let him do well. And if we can't keep him. At least we tried our best to win this season. But forcing him to sign a cheap contract would be racist. Because clearly Austin Reaves will also demand a higher contract with the way he is playing. Possibly higher than Rui's who is not even given a chance.

Rui averaged 19 points per 36 minutes with the Wizards even while being iced out of the offense. Kyle Kuzma was given a chance even though he wasn't restricted and may walk next season.

So it seems that the Wizard's coach was racist against him too. Wizards and Lakers might not make the playoffs this season because of their racism. Which would be sad.

Wizards would run 3 guard lineups with Rui too. It clearly illogical. The best explanation is a race issue. 

The phrase is called being ""Quietly Fired"". And it usually happens to minorities. He can legit sue the Lakers and the NBA if he fills as if he is being quietly fired for race. They are giving him less minutes to destroy his stats, his career, and his salary extension potential. He should contact his lawyers if that's what it takes to get his minutes. For him. Millions of dollars are on the line. And the Laker's season is also on the line.",1.0

9779,2023-03-27 18:11:22,123v94z,The next two games will challenge some of the lakers core issues,suhar97,"Let‚Äôs start with talking through our main issues:

- turnovers 

- energy / competitive fire 

- shot distribution 

- inability to handle strong perimeter defense (tied to turnovers) 

Chicago and Minnesota will both try to capitalize on all of the above to get wins against the Lakers. We struggle w physical perimeter defenders who do not allow our smaller / less physical guards to engage the defense the way they want to (see: losses to Minnesota, New York, Chicago). 

In addition, the time has gone for two things: 1) not being able to get your best players shots and 2) coming out flat and thinking you can win games

AD and lebron (to a lesser extent w return from injury) just have to be wrecking balls down the stretch. The role players are far too inconsistent to cover for games where AD shoots 8 times. This aggression is on both the staff and AD (and Bron). There‚Äôs no reason these 2 shouldn‚Äôt be in the top 3 of attempted FGs a game. The excuse can‚Äôt be ‚Äúwell they got schemed out‚Äù. Top players don‚Äôt get schemed out. Enough of that. 

Finally, competitive spirit. It‚Äôs been a staple post deadline for this group to be flat. Yes, you can‚Äôt play a game 7 every game and you‚Äôre gonna lose games along the way, but I can‚Äôt stand this cadence of once every 3-4 games everyone looks like they‚Äôre sleepwalking / wants to try and turn it on late. Again, enough is enough of that. This isn‚Äôt November and no more post game losses by the staff / players saying ‚Äúwe‚Äôll be better‚Äù. The time to be better is right now.

Finally the X factor: rotations. Faster adjustments on the fly plz. I get giving Lonnie a look, but in no case do I get giving Malik + Lonnie a look TOGETHER, even with dlo out. This staff has certainly cost us games but, again, we aren‚Äôt in December anymore.

This is all frustrating because the requisite talent is there. Please just be better.",1.0

While we can't control what's targeted to players in their social media/outside of this sub, we want to start becoming more strict of hateful comments that are made here towards the team. Temporary to permanent bans will be handed out to redditors that make non-basetball related hateful comments towards the team. Please continue to use the report feature so it's more easily brought to our attention.

Additionally, this also applies to anyone that visits other team subs and spread the same negativity. This shouldn‚Äôt even be a reminder, however some have decided that it‚Äôs okay to troll and brigade other subreddits. This is another warning that brigading will NOT be tolerated. If a scenario opens up, in which a moderator from any subreddit claims you have been brigading, we will not hesitate to take action that will lead to a temporary ban and could even result in a permanent ban.

With all that said, we recognize that r/Lakers is still a forum and fans come here as an outlet to share their joys and vent their frustrations. We don't want to censor anyone with their criticisms on players or coaches, but continue to encourage the constructive criticism and discussion.

9820,2023-03-29 16:32:52,125t5qy,Lebron &amp; DLo back in the starting lineup...I rewatched the Pelicans game from Feb.15th...im confident in prediction on rotation and substitution pattern going forward....,makethetradepelinka,"Starting Lineup...
AD, Reaves, DLo, Vanderbilt, Lebron

Reserves...
Brown, Schroeder, Rui, Gabriel, Beasley

General Substitution order...
1st sub: Lebron&gt;&gt;Troy Brown
2nd sub:Reaves&gt;&gt;Schroeder
3rd sub: Vanderbilt&gt;&gt;Rui
4th sub:DLo&gt;&gt;Beasley
5th sub:AD&gt;&gt;Gabriel
6th sub: Gabriel&gt;&gt;Lebron&gt;&gt;End of 1st qtr.
Start of 2nd.&gt;&gt;7th sub: Brown&gt;&gt;Gabriel
8th sub: Beasley&gt;&gt;Reaves
9th sub:Lebron&gt;&gt;Brown
10th sub:Rui&gt;&gt;Vanderbilt
11th sub: Schroeder&gt;&gt;DLo
12th sub: Gabriel&gt;&gt;AD
13th sub:Brown&gt;&gt;Lebron
14th sub: Reaves&gt;&gt;Beasley&gt;&gt;End of 1st half

Predictions: 
(1) Lebron will be the 1st on the bench...will close quarters/begin quarters with bench unit
(2)Troy Brown will be 1st off the bench as backup 3 to Lebron
(3) Rui will be back in rotation as backup 4 to Vanderbilt
(4) Beasley will be in rotation and close quarters with Lebron on the floor
(5)Lonnie Walker will be out of rotation
(6)Gabriel will not tandem with AD...just be used in spot minutes end of 1st/3rd&gt;&gt;beginning of 2nd/4th
(7) expect Reaves to be in closing lineups with DLo, AD, Lebron
(8)Brown/Vanderbilt will be 5th man in closing lineups based on matchups...

most importantly Lakers need consistent substitution pattern...players need to find the rhythm of getting consistent minutes within substitution pattern...

Been a while since i called a game the ""most important game of our season"" but tomorrow vs the Timberwolves effectively is. So get some rest today and be ready to do it better tomorrow.

As for the rooting guide, it was a 2-3 day but somehow the 2 wins greatly outweighed the 3 losses. The Timberwolves and Mavericks losing was great even though unfortunately the Jazz, Thunder and Clippers won. The results yesterday meant we moved up to the 8th seed and if we beat the Timberwolves tomorrow move up again into the 7th seed.

Today's guide is as straightforward as it gets.

**Rooting Guide.**

1.  **Nuggets(-6.5)** over the Pelicans

9912,2023-03-30 16:30:46,126s1r0,"It is painful to say this, but Ham gotta put Reaves to the bench and Beasley for the Starter",junahn,"The reason why it is painful to send Reaves to the bench is bc Dlo, Reaves, Lebron, Vando and AD is our best offensive(unless Beasley goes for 9/9 from three), defensive lineup that we have.

However we all witnessed the absolute devastation when we put Dennis with Malik. They were -20 and -17 together. Dennis is not the PLAYMAKER who can capable of making plays for shooters. He is a good driver but needs another playmaker which is Austin Reaves. With AR we have been top 3 bench teams in the league post ASG. Dennis works with AR really well and adding Rui Hachimura can make us back to best bench producing team in the league. 

For Beasley, I get the hate toward this man but for post season success, we need his firepower BADLY. But him in the bench is not the solution. Its not about him not making the shot, its about him making those dumbass turnovers which was a problem for his entire career. He can not be secondary handler with Dennis, he should be catch and shoot guy with legitimate handler. 

Which is why he needs to be with Lebron and DLo(Reaves if possible). he is inferior version of JR. Whether he makes his shot or not, he needs to play with Lebron in starting lineup",1.0
9913,2023-03-30 16:36:32,126s7g3,What's the Scenario? How the Lakers can end up with the 6 seed...,Zodraz,"If the Lakers win out to finish 44-38, then they just need Golden State to lose one more game to clinch at least the 6 seed. However, I think the Lakers winning out is fairly unlikely, given that they have to play Min, Pho, and LAC.

So below is what I think is a more plausible example of how the Lakers could finish with the six seed even if they lose one game (bold = assumed win, italics = assumed loss). 

We would likely need the Warriors to lose two of their three games against Den / OKC / Sac, and also need Min to lose to Brooklyn or NO.

Additional Notes:

**(1)** We want Phoenix to win their next 4 games, so that when they play us they already have the 4 or 5 spot locked up, and thus are even more likely to rest their starters on the second night of a back-to-back.

**(2)** The Clippers are a tough case -- we don't want to finish in a multi-way tie with them, because in certain scenarios our poor head-to-head record against them could knock us into the play-in. And the Clips losing four of their last five games seems unlikely. So I think we actually want them to finish one game better than us.

**(3)** Golden State losing two more games will depend a lot on how much Den and Sac have to play for. The Den game is early enough that Den may not have clinched the #1 seed yet, and I think Sac will be highly incentivized to know GS out of the six slot into the play-in.

**(4)** I've seen others on the board call Min's sked easy, and it is true that they have two gimme games against Por and SA. However, they'll be playing at Brooklyn against a Nets team trying to hold on to the six seed, and when they NO on the final day, that could be a must-win game for the Pelicans to make the play-in.

**(5)** Speaking of the Pelicans, there are scenarios where the Lakers finishing in a multi-way tie with them gets us a higher seed (for example: a four-way LAL / GS / MIN / NO tie at 43-39), so the Pelicans winning today against Den might actually increase our chances of getting the six seed. 

**(6)** Fun little tie-breaking quirk: if NO / Dal / OKC finish in a three-way tie, then I'm not completely sure, but I think NO (5-3) wins the tie-breaker based on common games and OKC (3-5) loses it, allowing Dal (3-4) to sneak into the 10 seed even though they lost 2 out of 3 to OKC...",1.0

Let‚Äôs discuss.,CoreyC96,"I believe Austin should remain in the starting lineup personally. He is a dynamic playmaker that actually plays very well off the ball with LeBron James. Just look at the start of this last game vs the Bulls. He had 8 points and and an assist in the first few minutes because he can score in a variety of ways that is more than just catch-and-shoot. The problem is Ham experimenting with subbing all starters minus AD for the bench mob when in reality he should be staggering minutes so that at least one of LeBron/DLo/Austin are on the floor at all times. Austin can still run the bench mob from the starting unit if we stagger minutes accordingly. I don‚Äôt want to completely give up hope on Beasley either. I would love to hear alternate takes and counter-arguments on how to maximize Beasley as well. Keep it civil boys and let‚Äôs discuss.

Big shoutout to Dennis and Rui for coming in off the bench to play great defense .

It feels weird to say but the month Lebron missed might end up being a turning point in AD's Lakers career because i feel like that's when the team finally leant how to win with AD being the best player on the floor. When he is this dominant on offence there isn't a player that can dominate the game on both ends of the floor like he can. 

Job's not finished though we have 3 more games on the revenge tour coming up vs the Rockets, Jazz and Clippers, so lets go beat all those teams.

A 3-1 night on last night's rooting guide with the Thunder, Jazz and Clippers all losing and even though the Spurs stayed though they couldn't beat the Warriors. Today is another important day with 2 games on the slate.

**Rooting Guide.**

1. **Heat(-2)** over the Mavericks
2. **Clippers(+2.5)** over the Pelicans

Still over the moon from last night, but it's important to still realize that there's work to be done. Get some rest today, hopefully AD's ankle doesn't get worse over night, and hope the team load up on vitamin C and ginger tea because the Wolves were spreading their germs all over last night.

Needless to say, we need to win out the rest of the games to ensure we're in the playoffs and at least in the play-in. Let's look at the best case and worst case scenarios. **Both are unlikely as we'll probably end up somewhere in between.**

**The best case scenario:** We win all five remaining games and end with a record of 44-38. This can place us as high as 4th in the standings if literally all the teams above us lose out.  

**The worst case scenario:** We lose all five remaining games and end with a record of 39-43. This can place us as a low as 12th standings and out of the play-in tournament. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Next three games:**

**04/02 - Lakers at Rockets**

The Rockets are 3-7 in their last ten. We lost the last game because we had no size. Bron, AD, and Bamba were out. The Rockets put up 78 points in the paint to our measly 46. We shot 25% from three, with Russell at 3-11 and Beasley with 4-12. Reaves was our highest scorer with 24, but struggled as well with 6-14 from the field and 1-7 from three. We have Bron and AD back. This should be a W.  

&amp;#x200B;

**04/04 - Lakers at Jazz** 

The Jazz are 4-6 in their last ten. We lost the last game against them in November, 116-139. We lost due to zero defensive cohesion and no Bron. Russ was -23 for the game. AD only grabbed 4 boards. We are a vastly better defensive team now and have Bron back. This should be a W.

&amp;#x200B;

**04/05 - Lakers at Clippers**

The Clippers are 6-4 in their last ten. We have lost every Clippers game since July 2020. We lost the last game against them in January, 115-133. We lost due to no size (no AD). Bryant was our starting center and Gabriel was only given 14 minutes. This loss was even worse than the score. We went 40% from three with Bron putting up an absurd 9-14 from range. With AD back, we can use their lack of big depth against them. We should pressure Plumlee and get him in foul trouble.  Considering this is a back to back game, I wouldn't be surprised if we rested AD and gave this one up.",1.0

This is gonna be almost too painful to watch them defend each other, with Bam Adebayo and Kyle Lowry out tonight. For Mavs only Ntilikina is out.

Asking Kevin Love to take much of the frontcourt responsibilities is too much of an ask at this point in his career. Hoping Luka explodes over a BS call and gets that 16th T at any point before the final game of the season.

Still hoping for a Mavs loss.

Picture this realistic scenario
Warriors go 2-2 (42-40 overall): 2 home games 2 road games so plausible. 

Suns continue to dominate and hold on to 4 seed

Clippers split their next 2 (42-39): one game to go. They lose to us so it‚Äôs plausible

Lakers go 4-1 (43-39): including a win vs the stupid Clippers. 

NOP - who cares assume they finish not involved

It‚Äôs now 1230p PT on April 9th and the Suns vs Clippers tips-off. If Clips win they have to play one of the hottest team in the West (The Suns) in the 4/5 matchup. If Suns win they have to play the other hottest team in the west (Lakers baby!).

They both wanna lose. They both try to rest players because it‚Äôs last game of the season. We‚Äôre all biting our nails hoping not to play the Suns in round 1.

10173,2023-04-03 05:01:28,12aa1nc,Suns Defensive Matchup Brainstorming,Willdebeast25,"Hypothetically, let‚Äôs say we finish the season strong and play the suns in the first round as the 5th seed. We beat them last time without KD and Ayton, and obviously Bron is back so the matchups would be different.             

Most likely, Ham would maintain the starting 5 as of late, but there would be mismatches defensively. Vando, who guarded Booker last time, would likely switch to Kd. You would put reaves on booker, and while he‚Äôs a decent on ball defender, I feel that booker would have a field day with him from the mid range. LeBron in playoffs is another breed, but idk if he could maintain guarding a shifty guard like him all game.

Now we know Bamba is hurt (should be back for the first round) and wenyen isn‚Äôt the best defender, but would it make more sense to play wenyen or Bamba along side AD, so AD could gaurd KD and one of the two could hold ayton and rebound. We‚Äôve also seen AD‚Äôs ability to fly around the floor as a 4 and it would less of mismatch physically than vando imo, for at least a portion of the game. 

Now this would slide vando over to booker, and our two best defenders would try their best to lock them down, since the rest of the suns depth is non existent. This lineup would run bron at point, dlo at 2-guard, then vando, AD, and Bamba/wenyen.

Now this may not be our first round matchup, but in case it was I want to know what you think about this hypothetical and if it would defensively match with them better. The lineup we have at the moment is working fantastically, but if size becomes an issue, we might need to play them like Vogel used the 2020 team with tall ball.

 ""The Lakers stink,"" Barkley said when asked to recap the first half. ""Y'all forcing us to show them all the time like they're going to be good.""¬†

Asked who was forcing him to discuss the Lakers, Barkley responded, ""The NBA.""

""It‚Äôs a conspiracy,"" he added. ""And then we got all these clowns on television having to talk about them every day""¬†

 Los Angeles entered [Tuesday‚Äôs game against Boston](https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nba/boston-celtics) with a record of 11-15, 12th in the Western Conference.¬† 

 Barkley wanted to know why the crew on ""Inside the NBA"" was talking about the 12th seed in the West, while the No. 12 seed in the Eastern Conference never gets discussed.¬† 

 ""We don‚Äôt ever talk about the Washington Wizards, do we? Ever,"" Barkley said. ""Do we ever mention the Washington Wizards? The great Bradley Beal? No.¬†

They deep dive into analytics and a bunch of us (40 or so people nightly) watch every game live, while Tim and Tom break down what is happening. The website allows us to sync up together and watch the games together live if you have a Cable/Internet/TV provider and it's always a great time. I just wanna give a shoutout to them because not many teams have this kind of in depth breakdown of the game as it's happening and the community that we have. So give it a shot. I have no investment in this so it's not an advertisement.

If you don't have Twitter, just check in just before tipoff https://www.playback.tv/LakersWatchParty

The odds for the pre play-in seeds (7 through out) and first round (post play-in, 4-8) seeds are listed separately. For simplicity, I'll list the odds for the 4-6 seeds, followed by the pre play-in seeds for the Lakers.

4: 0.2%

6: 21.2%

7: 24.5%

8: 21.3%

9: 13.6%

10: 1.7%

Out: 0.5%

The single most likely seed is 7. They have a 38.3% percent chance of finishing with the 4, 5, or 6 seed.

10328,2023-04-05 14:22:17,12clzpf,LeBron needs to rest today even if it puts us at risk of Play-in,CryptoNite90,"I saw the post earlier saying how any team could get how like Utah and we should avoid the play-in, and I agree, but not at the cost of LeBron re-aggravating his injury because of playing a back to back. 

Lebron just said post-game last night that he still wakes up with pain after game nights and he pretty much has a treatment plan on how to take care of it and then the pain subsides. 

We need to keep in mind that 2 out of 3 doctors already recommended a season ending surgery which LeBron avoided. This was a torn tendon and the man was driving into the paint all night and in scoring mode to ensure a victory for us which I feel he was trying to save for the playoffs to play that aggressively.

This is from an interview right before coming back from injury this time:

James got candid about whether or not he would undergo surgery following the regular season to treat the injury.

""I don't know,"" James said. ""Right now I don't need it, so we'll see what happens. I'll probably get another MRI at the end of the season and go from there.""",1.0

10333,2023-04-05 16:52:06,12cqjb2,Adopting the Long View,threepointcheese,"Dear Pessimists:

178 men and women have been inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame for their playing careers. 29 of these players have played on the Lakers. These names include:

G: **Kobe Bryant,** **Gail Goodrich**, **Magic Johnson**, Bobby Leonard, **Clyde Lovellette**, **Slater Martin**, Steve Nash, Don Nelson, Gary Payton, **Mitch Richmond**, **Jerry West**  
F: **Elgin Baylor**, Adrian Dantley, Karl Malone, Dennis Rodman, Charlie Scott, Jamaal Wilkes, **James Worthy**  
C: **Kareem Abdul-Jabbar**, Zelmo Beaty, **Wilt Chamberlain**, Vlade Divac, Connie Hawkins, **Spencer Haywood**, **Bob McAdoo**, **George Mikan**, **Vern Mikkelsen**, **Shaquille O'Neal**, **Jim Pollard**

Some of these men have been inducted for their playing careers elsewhere, for instance, Don Nelson, the lockdown sharpshooting guard, who had a limited role on the Lakers behind Jerry West but ultimately won championships with the franchise's greatest rival, the Boston Celtics. Some of these men have been inducted for their playing careers elsewhere but contributed to Laker titles as role players, for instance, Spencer Haywood, who late in his career played one year behind Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. 

This year, Pau Gasol will be inducted into the Hall of Fame for his time on the Lakers. His number was retired for that accolade and the two chips he won with the team, back to back, in 2009 and 2010. However, nearing the end of his time with the Lakers, fans of this franchise were begging for his trade. Calling him soft, calling him washed, Pau Gasol was unceremoniously dumped by rabid fans who wanted... other guys. It shames me to say, I was one of them.

The franchise currently rosters two Hall of Fame caliber players both of whom have won a championship with the Lakers. These players are LeBron James and Anthony Davis. These two players will win their second ring with the Lakers this year and, in all likelihood, go back to back for their third ring in five years, next year. Your pessimism is correct only on this front: it hasn't been the prettiest journey. When LeBron came to the franchise, we were stoked. We had LeBron fucking James, but we could also sense that you folks adopted him with mixed feelings, with the sort of... what the fuck are you going to do for us, old man, attitude. With Anthony Davis, his reception, to say the least, soured. After dominating in the bubble, Davis's aggressive playstyle has not been kind to his body and he has been injured for the last three years. Moreover, when he plays, it always takes him time to regain his top tier dominance.

But what if I told you these two men are precisely Lakers? Not Don Nelson, not Spencer Haywood, not Nash, GP, Malone, or Rodman. They aren't a Cavalier, a Heatle, nor a Pelican. These guys are thoroughbred Lakers. At the end of this run, LeBron James will have won 3 championships with the Lakers, while having played 7 years with the team with outstanding numbers, having raised his children here in the most critical parts of their upbringing. He's already played more years here than with the Heat and will have had more championships here than with the Heat (2) or Cavaliers (1). 

What if I told you AD is our second, dare I say, better, Pau Gasol? Sure, he's had his issues, but three rings? With at least five years on the team? Of course, management has to build correctly around him, but how is it that so many fans don't regard him as a Laker? Do we call to push him out when there's more in the tank, as with Pau, who was a two time all star post LA?

One of the things I love about this city is that we are super inclusive. It doesn't matter if you're white, black, mexican, or asian, if you're LA, you're LA. It's a vibe. But sometimes that inclusiveness, the bubble, if you will, lashes out hard against, outsiders. Someone like LeBron, someone like AD. Is it right to have that mentality?  Maybe, maybe not. The worst of you will retaliate asking if they've earned it. To that, all I can say is this, it relates to this city, who's done more. You in whatever the fuck you're doing or their three rings.

In what reality do you have to be in to start the crucial CRUCIAL 4th quarter with Dennis Schroder AND MALIK BEASLEY??? AT THE SAME TIME??? Literally the two smallest guys on our team, one of which is completely reliant on shots being created for him and the other only creates shots for himself, not to mention he is having a terrible shooting night????

Putting in Wenyen Gabriel as your backup C for the night when he is getting bullied by two of the strongest centers in the league, WHEN MO BAMBA IS RIGHT THERE AND CAN ALSO BE A FLOOR SPACER?!?! That is a game losing decision. 

Not recognizing that schroder is having an off-night and still pairing him up with D-Lo even though Malik Beasley was hitting his shots early? Does he not realize how much more sense a dlo-beasley backcourt makes when beasley is hitting??? Especially when he is struggling lately and we need to squeeze out any sort of three point shooting we can get from him because that is literally the only thing he provides this team??? That is a game losing decision. 

I understand he is a rookie coach, and I an generally patient with him, but he clearly has shown 0 willingness to change what isnt working and 0 willingness to take advantage of what is working (unless it involves schroder). It is mindblowing. We need to be competing right now, and ham seems like a good guy but he CLEARLY does not fit the timetable.

\- We don't have a backup center, I've been saying it for 3 weeks. Wenyen got destroyed by Zubac/Plumlee

\- We got torched by Bones Hyland and Norman Powell. If we can't guard these fools, then we have no hope of guarding the elite players of other teams

&amp;#x200B;

What we should've done:

\- TBJ should've been on Norman Powell, not Kawhi

\- Schroeder/Reaves on Bones Hyland NOT Beasley 

\- Rui did a decent job on Kawhi, would give him some spot minutes 

\- Bamba should've played because AD couldn't contain both Zubac/Plumlee all night although he got a few blocks on Zubac near the end 

\- Dlo had a solid game, should've drawn up more plays for him

* LeBron had the worst game of his life in the 1st half, there's no way he ever plays that bad again. He was cooking whoever was in front of him in the 2nd half
* 3rd game in 4 days, there was a reason both stars were GTD decision

Small Positives
* Slowed down Kawhi in the 2nd half really well, 

Negatives - 
* Ham taking way too long to take timeouts and leaving Dennis in when Powell was abusing him
* Leaving Wenyen all alone on Zubac? This should had been the time to test out Bamba, to see what he has before the playoffs
* Another game where the opponent is on fire from 3, we need to throw in some zone from time to time to keep them guessing

Yeah, it sucks that we will be in the play-ins but if we can't beat 2 play-in teams than we never deserved a chance, and I'm also quite confident in our ability against Denver and Memphis",1.0
10415,2023-04-06 04:51:34,12d9guv,Is there anyone else here who isn‚Äôt worried about this loss? Or is it just me?,shadylocko,"Look, I get it. We lost to the Flippers for the 11th, count it, ELEVENTH time in a row. It absolutely stings, and the Lakers looked gassed and terrible (especially Lebron) for most of it. Not to mention the Pelicans and Mavericks overcame their own deficits and picked up Ws tonight while we didn‚Äôt.

But it‚Äôs not the end of the world. In fact we still have a chance for the 6th seed. The Flippers may have us completely and utterly downloaded and saved into their internal hard drives, but I want to remind you all that if they finish the 5th seed, they gotta play the Suns in the first round. And not only that, but if we finish 6th or 7th, we won‚Äôt even face the Clippers until the WCF, assuming both of us even get that far (which the Flippers most likely won‚Äôt since they gotta go through probably the Suns and Nuggets in a row). Of course we gotta take it one game at a time too.

If this is sounding like I‚Äôm afraid of that damn team, then it‚Äôs half true. I believe they are by far our worst matchup in the West (yes even more than a full powered Suns). Reason is at full power they have a better bench compared to the Suns and the coach is smart with using Westbrook. And finally at this point they have a mental advantage over the Lakers (I don‚Äôt think you could simply just brush off a 11 game losing streak on a team like that).

Im not saying that the Flippers will absolutely sweep us, as I do believe we still got a chance at beating them in a series, but it depends on a lot of factors, such as health and how well Darvin Ham can out coach Lue. I‚Äôm just trying to be realistic at our situation here. 

tldr: This loss isn‚Äôt the end of everything. We‚Äôll bounce back. Go Lakers. As for the Flippers, congrats on the win and enjoy getting destroyed by KD in the first round. üëç",0.99

So our 2 most used non AD lineups where Lebron is still in didn't include either reaves or dlo, the lineup has no spacing and no defense.

 Also Wenyen isnt a capable backup 5 on any team, activating Bamba and not playing him makes absolutely no sense

We had to win on the road against Bulls, Minnesota, Clippers, take care of business against Houston and Utah, and still have Suns coming up. All these while we had to throw 3 games in 4 nights into the mix.

We played well but it's unrealistic to expect all of these games to be Ws. 4-1 for the road trip is still great. 

1 Warriors loss in their last remaining 2 games would still really benefit us, but if not, a 7th seed would not be bad. 1 win out of 2 elimination games at home is more than possible.

10430,2023-04-06 09:19:05,12dedeo,Stay positive Laker fans,ThunderClown101,"The Lakers have ended the road-trip with a 4-1 record. 

They lost the only game they should have lost. A final game of a road-trip, third game in four nights and a second night of a B2B against a Clippers team who had 3 days of rest. 

Still, the whole squad came in, competed and went home HEALTHY after playing 3 games in 4 nights. 

What did the Clippers do with this game? They secured the 5th seed most likely. 

The Lakers have 2 more games to play and they are favored in both of them.

The Phoenix Suns will be playing against us on a second night of a back to back. They already have the 4th seed locked up and there is no incentive for them to go hard on Friday.

Then the Lakers play the Jazz at home. They should take care of their business.

So best case scenario - the Lakers win the remaining games, the Warriors lose to the Kings tomorrow and the Lakers get that sweet 6th seed. 

Worst case scenario - the Lakers lose out, Warriors win their 2 games and the Lakers face off against the Pelicans in the play-in for that 7th spot. 

No matter what happens, if they make the playoffs, the Lakers will not face the Suns, the Clippers or the Nuggets in the first 2 rounds. 

Stay positive and appreciate what the Lakers have done in the last 25 games.

10436,2023-04-06 14:18:50,12dls58,"Why AD is so ""inconsistent""",Its_TooEasy,"See a ton of fans complaining that AD is so inconsistent. Yes, I get that he sometimes isn't as aggressive as he should be but it's frustrating hearing that he isn't consistent after a game like last night.

AD gets doubled on the mid block / mid range area which is the worst place to get doubled. He'll pass it out to the 3pt line to make the right play but because of where he generally is, it's much easier for the defense to rotate out and prevent and open shot. Compare this to a KD or Curry, players who would get doubled above the 3pt line where rotating over is much, much harder and a pass to a open shot is much easier.   
Each time he wasn't doubled he took a shot or made a play. I'm not making excuses, I'm just saying it's up to Ham to really try and turn a double into a real advantage rather than what happens now (just lose time on the shot clock).  Not a fan Ham with his lineups and play calls btw.

As someone whose seen most of his games the last 5-6 years, I wanted to highlight a key, positive detail that I have not yet seen mentioned: the distance of his 3 pt shots

To me, one indication of where lebron is at physically is the distance at which he attempts his 3s. For instance, post Solomon hill, it feels we‚Äôve seen far less of the ‚ÄúLeLogo‚Äù shots that we saw in 2019-2020. Part of this is age, but part of this is where his body is at.

Last night, not only did he make a few, but he was bombing away. The one he hit early in the 3rd quarter was the type that really opens the eyes. I would encourage everyone to watch his highlights and take note of this point.

So yes there was a lot wrong in the game - much of which is tied to brons first half - but this is a small but important silver lining and positive takeaway to keep in mind",1.0

Problem with Ham is he just leaves Vanderbilt to stand on the corner 3 point line. Unacceptable in today‚Äôs NBA to have a non-shooter do nothing but stand on the corner and shoot. Other teams just dare Vanderbilt to shoot, so they leave him to double team AD in the post.

Jackson on the other hand understood that Rodman is a rebounder and best used around the paint. Phil doesn‚Äôt have Rodman just standing on the corner, instead he keeps him constantly in motion by playing Rodman on the elbow around the paint to set screens, to play handoff on curls, and cuts to the basket for layups or offensive rebounds making Rodman an efficient part of the Bulls‚Äô offense.

If we win out, we are guaranteed the 7th spot, but given that the 9th spot Twolves are at 40-40 and they play the Pelicans the worst scenarios if we lose to the Jazz, we will end up 42-40. 

If: 

- Pelicans win out, putting them at 43-39, 1 game above us, but since they play the Twolves, the most the Twolves could win if they lose against the Pelicans is 41, a game below us. We would be the 8th seed. 

- Twolves win out, putting all of us at 42-40, with a three way tie. 

Per the NBA rules, when there is a three way tie, the tie breaker is the highest win percentage among games of the three teams. 

a. We are 3-1 vs NOP (thanks to Matt Ryan) and 1-2 vs Minnesota, 4-3, a win percentage of 57%. 

b. NoP are 1-3 vs us, and if they lose to the TWolves, they‚Äôll end up at 1-2 vs them, or 2-5, a win percentage of 28%. 

c. Minnesota would be the best, 4-2, making them 7, and we would be 8th seed.


So we are currently going to end anywhere from 6-8th, not bad given our start. 

We‚Äôre 6th if we win and the Warriors blow their last game. 

We‚Äôre 7th if we win and the Warriors win.

Next season, AR will only get better, I‚Äôm guessing a better shooter since he always complains about missing 1 or 2 free throws postgame.

If his numbers post All-star break are any indication of his future (he‚Äôs averaging 18 points on a super efficient 57/42/85 split with a +144) and Lakers having a winning record, couldn't he be All-Star Reaves next season in only his 3rd year?

I know everyone wants to face the Kings in the first round - despite them having the top offense in NBA history - but I don‚Äôt see the Grizzlies as an intimidating matchup either since our roster matches up so much better now post-trade deadline. And if Lakers win that series it then matches them up with the winner of Kings/Warriors (the likeliest 3/6 matchup), both teams I still think we match up well against, avoiding the Suns/Clippers winner and the Nuggets (who I believe are severely underrated despite being the 1 Seed) until the WCF, allowing us to build our chemistry a bit more against teams I think we match up lineup-wise and maybe wear them down after what will be tougher series than the Kings/Warriors winner.

This team has been playing so well that even someone like him is forced to admit it. Every fiber of his being wants to discredit the Lakers, but it‚Äôs at a point where doing that is so blatantly inaccurate, that he can‚Äôt do it without risking his reputation as someone with serious basketball analysis.

The full quote was: ‚Äú[People have been saying the Celtics] might have to face the Lakers in the finals! I just think it‚Äôs impossible for them to stay healthy for three straight rounds.‚Äù 

That was the first take, that it‚Äôs impossible. Without skipping a beat he went on to say: ‚ÄúI just don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs realistic.‚Äù We‚Äôve gone from impossible to not realistic.

Finally he ends on: ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs at least not unrealistic, it‚Äôs in play.‚Äù We‚Äôve made the leap from not realistic to not unrealistic, insert Nick Young ??? face. The man CAN NOT EVEN FORM A COHERENT THOUGHT he‚Äôs so shook by how good the Lakers are.

10662,2023-04-10 12:42:38,12hho5y,How to bypass League Pass Geo-blocking + Avoid Local Blackouts,HammyC," 

Attention NBA fans! Want to catch all the action of the NBA League Pass without having to worry about local blackouts? Well, we‚Äôve got you covered! In this guide, we will show you how to successfully get League Pass working with VPN and blackout games.

Step-by-Step Guide:

1. Purchase an international NBA League Pass subscription with VPN enabled. We recommend using India as a location, which will cost you less than $19 a year. If your VPN has trouble connecting to India, you can try connecting to Mongolia or Turkey. It will cost you around $40ish dollars for a year of LP.
2. Install Location Guard, an extension available for some supported browsers.
3. Set your **FIXED LOCATION** to anywhere outside the blackout area. It doesn't matter where you choose, but we recommend Mumbai, India. Make sure that your default level is set to ""use fixed location"".
4. Sign out of NBA.com and clear out your NBA.com cookies. You can do this by going to the settings for your browser and searching ""cookies"". Then, delete all your cookies or search for ""NBA"" and just delete everything from NBA.com.
5. Log in to your NBA account with both Location Guard and VPN enabled. The location doesn't have to be the same as your purchased LP. As long as it is out of the blackout area, you can connect to any location outside the blackout area. If you're having trouble connecting to India VPN, you can just connect to Mexico or another location instead.
6. DISABLE YOUR VPN AFTER YOU SUCCESSFULLY LOG IN. THE VIDEO PLAYER WILL NOT LOAD WITH VPN ACTIVE.
7. With Location Guard enabled, you can now watch all non-blackout NBA games! Enjoy all the action of the NBA League Pass without worrying about local blackouts.

FYI: I'm using NordVPN personally and I got my VPN on a Discount from this [**Community Website**](https://www.vpngrades.com/)**.**

For everyone else...

How do we feel about the Lakers right now?

A - With Bron, even at his advanced age, when he's on a decent team and the key players are healthy, a deep post season run should always be expected. After all, the man has led his squads to 10 Finals, including 8 in a row (for two different teams). They could win it all this year if they just stay healthy.

B - If they pass the play-in and win the first round, they will have revealed themselves as true contenders who get stronger every round. Along with the Warriors, they are the scariest team in the playoffs.

C - This team, after the Westbrook trade, does indeed have enough to win it all. However, they need a full season to develop chemistry first. They will likely have an early exit.

D - Sadly, I can't imagine AD staying healthy throughout the entire playoffs. I feel like his body is broken down, and he's always on the precipice of missing a few weeks. Due to that, they can't go far.

E - Other.

Personally, I'm pretty hopeful. I'm leaning (A) or (B), but could cope with (C).",1.0

I see a lot of y‚Äôall in this sub rn trash talking saying this gonna be an easy win and laughing at how stupid the wolves are. 

We should still win this game, but to be honest, we haven‚Äôt looked great these last 4 games. AD hasn‚Äôt been himself for any of those games and scored over 20 only once. We went 3-1 in those games but we played 3 g league teams and played close games with all of them. If we play like we‚Äòve played these last few games, things won‚Äôt go our way and we need this win. The team clearly has some dead legs and need some rest.

Minnesota are also still a good team, they just beat the pels despite all the drama that happened in that game. Ant is a stud and he can go off any night, KAT seems to be back in the swing of things and the Wolves have honestly been playing much better without Gobert and their offense actually looks real solid. 

We have to come into his game with the right mindset and crush these guys! If we go in thinking this is gonna be easy, we‚Äôre gonna lose, it‚Äôs a simple as that. I wouldn‚Äôt count the Wolves out just yet, but if we go out there with the right mentality and mindset, the sky is the limit. Go Lakers!",1.0

- We easily beat the Wolves tomorrow, their team is a disaster right now and we have Dennis coming back and a center to help AD. Then the Wolves get eliminated by OKC/Pelicans. 

#Play Offs 
- We go up against the Grizzlies, they don't have Steven Adams so we should have an advantage over them, I'm guessing we'll go like 4-1 or 4-2. 

From there the Media will start going nuts on how the Lakers beat the 2nd seed team in the West and more attention and pressure will be put on Lakers and Bron. 

- I think the Warriors will destroy the Kings so we'll play Warriors next. This will be very challenging as the Warriors will have Wiggins back but we were like 3-1 with the Warriors this season, I think we can pull it off 4-3. Flightreactz goes apeshit.

- After all that we will go against the Suns or Clippers or Nuggets (sorry Pelicans/OKC) if we play Suns or Clippers I think we get eliminated so we should root for the Nuggets. If we play Nuggets I truly believe we can destroy them
4-1 or even 4-0. 

- Now Lakers make it to the final and I could see them going up against either Celtics, Bucks or 76ers. If it's Celtics or Bucks we lose but if 76ers somehow make it to the final, we win.

For those who don't know, Ingram was a 32-year-old rookie at the time, who had spent 10 seasons playing in the NBA G League. He was a standout player for the South Bay Lakers, and after a series of injuries hit the Lakers' roster, the team decided to give Ingram a shot.

And boy, did he make the most of it. In his debut game against the Houston Rockets, Ingram scored 19 points on 6-of-8 shooting, including 4-of-5 from beyond the arc. He also grabbed 3 rebounds and dished out 1 assist in 29 minutes of play.

But it wasn't just the numbers that impressed fans and teammates alike. It was Ingram's attitude and work ethic that stood out. He had spent years grinding in the G League, waiting for his chance to prove himself at the highest level. And when that chance finally came, he didn't disappoint.

Ingram's performance earned him a standing ovation from the Staples Center crowd, as well as praise from his teammates and coaches. Lakers coach Luke Walton called him a ""phenomenal human being,"" and said that he had ""earned every bit of the right to be here.""

Ingram would go on to play one more game for the Lakers that season, scoring 5 points in a loss to the Clippers. He then signed a two-way contract with the Lakers for the following season, and played in 4 games for the team before being waived in March 2019.

But even though his time with the Lakers was brief, Ingram's story is one that will always be remembered by Lakers fans. He showed us all that hard work and perseverance can pay off, even when the odds seem stacked against you. And for that, we are forever grateful.",1.0

His three point shots tend to fall down, and his mid range jumpshots is very effective when it comes to post season. Tonight he scored 12 points but with some big buckets down the stretch and some great interior defense against KAT and Kyle Anderson. 

I hope Darvin can use Rui more than Vando. Although Vando is hell of a defender unless he knocks down some open threes he is liability of offense. Rui being our physical defender/transition offense/scorer can be huge for post season",1.0

The crowd was HYPED. Despite awesome shooting until the 4th, Wolves ate shit when it mattered most. Going to really enjoy the Memphis series and excited that LA made it in after this crazy season. 

That said I am a devotee of Lord Westbrook and must remind everyone of what he gave y‚Äôall this year:

- He played 52 games on the season for LAL before the deadline while Lebron has played 56, AD 57. Play-in excluded. 

- He logged 1491 minutes in those games, 6th total on the team. 

- Russ ended the season still leading the Lakers in assist per game and in total assists with 391 over those 52 games.

- He remains 3rd in total steals for the Lakers, 5th in total points (just 3 and 6 behind Schr√∂der and Reaves), 3rd in total rebounds, and 5th in total blocks. 

Think what you want about being a net positive but he showed up as much as anybody and you weren‚Äôt getting that contribution without him pre-trade. Give my guy a ring if LAL wins it all.",1.0

Since returning from injury lebron has been the lakers worst rotation player. He was -14 last night bringing his +/- to a whopping 0 over the last five games. Our offense becomes stagnate when he‚Äôs on the floor and it‚Äôd be a stretch to say he‚Äôs an active defender. I still think he can positively affect the game in transition and as the roll man but I believe he needs to take a more  back seat role for the lakers to make noise in the playoffs.,1.0

10919,2023-04-12 15:50:56,12jqe25,I really want Austin Reaves to start off the bench and put Beasley as a starter,junahn,"Now Im not saying that because AR didnt play last night. But Beasley at the starting lineup is better. Although Austin reaves is better defender, playmaker(not even a comparison), and decision maker, he needs to take a role as a knock down shooter if it comes to playoffs. Which he is not and he is always hesitant to shoot threes under playoff level defense. And considering his physicality and his speed he struggles to score like he used to in regular season because the call is much more tougher in the playoffs.

Reason why I want Beasley as a starting lineup is first, he can score in the playoffs and can get hot from three even in playoff atmosphere. He can draw attention and he has athleticism to drive to the paint also. We also have some sample size where we destroyed good teams by large margin by putting Beasley as a starter with a full lineup(against NOP, GSW twice). If Malik struggles, we can put AR early to the lineup.

What Im saying is that AR is better as a bench leader with Dennis and that makes us one of the best bench production team in the league right now. Also Beasley is our valuable sharpshooter and whether he makes a three or not, he can be contributor of drawing defense or creating space for Lebron to drive and AD to be at the paint.",1.0

10923,2023-04-12 17:10:38,12jsr7k,Bamba Starting?,LordWeaseltown,"So I've long since given up on Mo Bamba seeing any significant play this season, but when we got him, my first thoughts were ""wow, we could do 2020 again, but even better!

Imagine a starting lineup of LeBron, D'Lo, Vando, AD, and Bamba. Compared to the 2020 lineup of LeBron, Avery Bradley, KCP, AD, JaVale

This lineup would be even longer, with far better spacing, and there would be a secondary creator on the court so PG LeBron could get help with facilitation. Vando, while not a floor spacer at all, is certainly moreso than JaVale, and Bamba's shooting means AD would have a much more open paint than he did starting at the 4 in 2020.

On defense, D'Lo wouldn't be under as much pressure and could be more physical with all that length on the back end, he does have solid length for a guard. Vando could take whichever SG/SF is more of an offensive threat. I feel like the 2020 Lakers and the last few years' Bucks have shown that having that much length on the back end makes perimeter defense so much easier

Plus it would save AD the wear and tear from playing the 5 and let him do what he did in 2020: terrorize attackers from the weak side.

What are your thoughts about a lineup like that?  I know this game is pace and space now, but the the Lakers won a championship with this formula before and I think there's still merit to just being bigger, longer, and more athletic than the other team",1.0

10968,2023-04-14 08:21:26,12lpiyv,The Last Couple of (horrible) Years Have Made us Forgotten what a Concrete Championship Team is,BrainEuphoria,"I want to start by saying that I believe the Lakers can make some noise this postseason, but we haven‚Äôt fully account for Lebron‚Äôs aging to see that he needs more help than we realize. He could fare much better by not being overexposed and always missing significant time to injuries if his teammates take more load off of him.

I think we may be too critical of AD. He‚Äôs the only player that when he gives you 21pts and 12 rebounds, it is called a disaster. Expecting 30pts and 20 rebounds every single night is insane. If you need AD to have that kind of Monster game to convincingly win, then maybe his teammates should chip in a little more? High intensity defense exhausts you and fighting for offensive boards or operating in the paint the way he does takes energy. Maybe that exacerbates his glass nature? 

Surround AD and Lebron with bodies that spreads the burden more, so when they take nights off or possessions off, people won‚Äôt call for heads.

Reaves is a forever Laker, but let‚Äôs be real, he‚Äôs not starting on a legit championship level team (Bucks, Celtics, Cavs, Knicks, Clippers, Suns, Warriors‚Ä¶Wolves). We should absolutely keep him and I love what Reaves bring to the table, but his value might be a tad bit inflated as a Laker.

DLo is streaky, injury prone and chokes in the playoffs. I think he‚Äôll fare better this playoffs bc he‚Äôs all we‚Äôve got alongside Shroeder and Reaves. I like him and would much rather keep DLo as a fourth guy or rotation player, which means we need a clear and more reliable third option.

Once AD/Lebron goes to the bench, minions take over. It‚Äôs easy for opponents to feast on that, especially when DLo is injured and Vando non existent on offense.

Vando is athletic and solid defensively. I prefer a decent two-way big. It‚Äôs like 4on5 on offense but I like Vando‚Äôs defensive intensity.

I prefer reliable shooters over streaky Beasley. He‚Äôs useless when his 3 ball isn‚Äôt falling and that‚Äôs not good at all. You‚Äôre one man down in rotation when he has a bad 3pt shooting night and he has more of those than anything else.

Wenyen‚Ä¶.I won‚Äôt even go there. 

Rui and Shroeder are good pieces.

This roster is clearly an upgrade compared to pre-deadline and because our past roster constructions has been so horrendous, we don‚Äôt remember how good a championship team should be.

Overall we should explore strengthening our team and increasing our depth this offseason.",1.0

10975,2023-04-14 17:04:41,12m3zoe,Worried About Vanderbilt Starting,SpaceAndBball,"Wolves made a key adjustment when they put Anderson on AD rather than KAT. They put KAT on Vando and left him wide open, resulting in a double team to AD with no consequence. That forces AD to make a pass out of a double team which he sucks at. And if he somehow passes to a cutting Vando, I don‚Äôt trust Vando given his butter fingers and ability to finish. 

This led to so many turnovers, and we were forced to take Vando out of the game. I fear Grizz would do the same thing with Tillman on AD and JJJ on Vando roaming the paint. 

Any strategies on how coach would counter this? Easy one is replace Vando with Rui, but I would love Vando‚Äôs defence on Bane",1.0
